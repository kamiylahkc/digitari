JOURNAL Kept in shorthand 3 May BistritzLeft Munich at 835 P M on 1st May arriving at Vienna early next morning should have arrived at 646 but train was an hour late BudaPesth seems a wonderful place from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets I feared to go very far from the station as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube which is here of noble width and depth took us among the traditions of Turkish rule We left in pretty good time and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale I had for dinner or rather supper a chicken done up some way with red pepper which was very good but thirsty Mem get recipe for Mina I asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika hendl and that as it was a national dish I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians I found my smattering of German very useful here indeed I dont know how I should be able to get on without it Having had some time at my disposal when in London I had visited the British Museum and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country just on the borders of three states Transylvania Moldavia and Bukovina in the midst of the Carpathian mountains one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps but I found that Bistritz the post town named by Count Dracula is a fairly wellknown place I shall enter here some of my notes as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities Saxons in the South and mixed with them the Wallachs who are the descendants of the Dacians Magyars in the West and Szekelys in the East and North I am going among the latter who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns This may be so for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool if so my stay may be very interesting Mem I must ask the Count all about them I did not sleep well though my bed was comfortable enough for I had all sorts of queer dreams There was a dog howling all night under my window which may have had something to do with it or it may have been the paprika for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe and was still thirsty Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then I had for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was mamaliga and eggplant stuffed with forcemeat a very excellent dish which they call impletata Mem get recipe for this also I had to hurry breakfast for the train started a little before eight or rather it ought to have done so for after rushing to the station at 730 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains What ought they to be in China All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods It takes a lot of water and running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear At every station there were groups of people sometimes crowds and in all sorts of attire Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany with short jackets and round hats and homemade trousers but others were very picturesque The women looked pretty except when you got near them but they were very clumsy about the waist They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet but of course there were petticoats under them The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks who were more barbarian than the rest with their big cowboy hats great baggy dirtywhite trousers white linen shirts and enormous heavy leather belts nearly a foot wide all studded over with brass nails They wore high boots with their trousers tucked into them and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches They are very picturesque but do not look prepossessing On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands They are however I am told very harmless and rather wanting in natural selfassertion It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz which is a very interesting old place Being practically on the frontierfor the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovinait has had a very stormy existence and it certainly shows marks of it Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13000 people the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel which I found to my great delight to be thoroughly oldfashioned for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country I was evidently expected for when I got near the door I faced a cheerylooking elderly woman in the usual peasant dresswhite undergarment with long double apron front and back of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty When I came close she bowed and said The Herr Englishman Yes I said Jonathan Harker She smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves who had followed her to the door He went but immediately returned with a letter My FriendWelcome to the Carpathians I am anxiously expecting you Sleep well tonight At three tomorrow the diligence will start for Bukovina a place on it is kept for you At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land Your friend DRACULA 4 MayI found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent and pretended that he could not understand my German This could not be true because up to then he had understood it perfectly at least he answered my questions exactly as if he did He and his wife the old lady who had received me looked at each other in a frightened sort of way He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter and that was all he knew When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula and could tell me anything of his castle both he and his wife crossed themselves and saying that they knew nothing at all simply refused to speak further It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask any one else for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting Just before I was leaving the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way Must you go Oh young Herr must you go She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all I was just able to follow her by asking many questions When I told her that I must go at once and that I was engaged on important business she asked again Do you know what day it is I answered that it was the fourth of May She shook her head as she said again Oh yes I know that I know that but do you know what day it is On my saying that I did not understand she went on It is the eve of St Georges Day Do you not know that tonight when the clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will have full sway Do you know where you are going and what you are going to She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her but without effect Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go at least to wait a day or two before starting It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable However there was business to be done and I could allow nothing to interfere with it I therefore tried to raise her up and said as gravely as I could that I thanked her but my duty was imperative and that I must go She then rose and dried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me I did not know what to do for as an English Churchman I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind She saw I suppose the doubt in my face for she put the rosary round my neck and said For your mothers sake and went out of the room I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach which is of course late and the crucifix is still round my neck Whether it is the old ladys fear or the many ghostly traditions of this place or the crucifix itself I do not know but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual If this book should ever reach Mina before I do let it bring my goodbye Here comes the coach      5 May The CastleThe grey of the morning has passed and the sun is high over the distant horizon which seems jagged whether with trees or hills I know not for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed I am not sleepy and as I am not to be called till I awake naturally I write till sleep comes There are many odd things to put down and lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz let me put down my dinner exactly I dined on what they called robber steakbits of bacon onion and beef seasoned with red pepper and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire in the simple style of the London cats meat The wine was Golden Mediasch which produces a queer sting on the tongue which is however not disagreeable I had only a couple of glasses of this and nothing else When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat and I saw him talking with the landlady They were evidently talking of me for every now and then they looked at me and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the doorwhich they call by a name meaning wordbearercame and listened and then looked at me most of them pityingly I could hear a lot of words often repeated queer words for there were many nationalities in the crowd so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out I must say they were not cheering to me for amongst them were OrdogSatan pokolhell stregoicawitch vrolok and vlkoslakboth of which mean the same thing one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either werewolf or vampire Mem I must ask the Count about these superstitions When we started the crowd round the inn door which had by this time swelled to a considerable size all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me With some difficulty I got a fellowpassenger to tell me what they meant he would not answer at first but on learning that I was English he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye This was not very pleasant for me just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but every one seemed so kindhearted and so sorrowful and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the innyard and its crowd of picturesque figures all crossing themselves as they stood round the wide archway with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard Then our driver whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the boxseatgotza they call themcracked his big whip over his four small horses which ran abreast and we set off on our journey I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along although had I known the language or rather languages which my fellowpassengers were speaking I might not have been able to throw them off so easily Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods with here and there steep hills crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses the blank gable end to the road There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossomapple plum pear cherry and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the Mittel Land ran the road losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame The road was rugged but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste I could not understand then what the haste meant but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund I was told that this road is in summertime excellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order Of old the Hospadars would not repair them lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves Right and left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown where grass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags till these were themselves lost in the distance where the snowy peaks rose grandly Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snowcovered peak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way to be right before us Look Isten szekGods seatand he crossed himself reverently As we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held the sunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks all in picturesque attire but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent By the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even turn round as we approached but seemed in the selfsurrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world There were many things new to me for instance hayricks in the trees and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves Now and again we passed a leiterwagonthe ordinary peasants cartwith its long snakelike vertebra calculated to suit the inequalities of the road On this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants the Cszeks with their white and the Slovaks with their coloured sheepskins the latter carrying lancefashion their long staves with axe at end As the evening fell it began to get very cold and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills as we ascended through the Pass the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of latelying snow Sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed the trees produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghostlike clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys Sometimes the hills were so steep that despite our drivers haste the horses could only go slowly I wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home but the driver would not hear of it No no he said you must not walk here the dogs are too fierce and then he added with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantryfor he looked round to catch the approving smile of the restand you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep The only stop he would make was a moments pause to light his lamps When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers and they kept speaking to him one after the other as though urging him to further speed He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us as though there were a cleft in the hills The excitement of the passengers grew greater the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea I had to hold on The road grew more level and we appeared to fly along Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us we were entering on the Borgo Pass One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial these were certainly of an odd and varied kind but each was given in simple good faith with a kindly word and a blessing and that strange mixture of fearmeaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritzthe sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye Then as we flew along the driver leaned forward and on each side the passengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the darkness It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected but though I asked each passenger no one would give me the slightest explanation This state of excitement kept on for some little time and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side There were dark rolling clouds overhead and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres and that now we had got into the thunderous one I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps in which the steam from our harddriven horses rose in a white cloud We could see now the sandy road lying white before us but there was on it no sign of a vehicle The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mock my own disappointment I was already thinking what I had best do when the driver looking at his watch said to the others something which I could hardly hear it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone I thought it was An hour less than the time Then turning to me he said in German worse than my own There is no carriage here The Herr is not expected after all He will now come on to Bukovina and return tomorrow or the next day better the next day Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up Then amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves a calche with four horses drove up behind us overtook us and drew up beside the coach I could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them that the horses were coalblack and splendid animals They were driven by a tall man with a long brown beard and a great black hat which seemed to hide his face from us I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes which seemed red in the lamplight as he turned to us He said to the driver You are early tonight my friend The man stammered in reply The English Herr was in a hurry to which the stranger replied That is why I suppose you wished him to go on to Bukovina You cannot deceive me my friend I know too much and my horses are swift As he spoke he smiled and the lamplight fell on a hardlooking mouth with very red lips and sharplooking teeth as white as ivory One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burgers Lenore Denn die Todten reiten schnell For the dead travel fast The strange driver evidently heard the words for he looked up with a gleaming smile The passenger turned his face away at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself Give me the Herrs luggage said the driver and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calche Then I descended from the side of the coach as the calche was close alongside the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel his strength must have been prodigious Without a word he shook his reins the horses turned and we swept into the darkness of the Pass As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses and off they swept on their way to Bukovina As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill and a lonely feeling came over me but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders and a rug across my knees and the driver said in excellent German The night is chill mein Herr and my master the Count bade me take all care of you There is a flask of slivovitz the plum brandy of the country underneath the seat if you should require it I did not take any but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same I felt a little strangely and not a little frightened I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey The carriage went at a hard pace straight along then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again and so I took note of some salient point and found that this was so I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant but I really feared to do so for I thought that placed as I was any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay Byandby however as I was curious to know how time was passing I struck a match and by its flame looked at my watch it was within a few minutes of midnight This gave me a sort of shock for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences I waited with a sick feeling of suspense Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the roada long agonised wailing as if from fear The sound was taken up by another dog and then another and another till borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass a wild howling began which seemed to come from all over the country as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they quieted down but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright Then far off in the distance from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howlingthat of wolveswhich affected both the horses and myself in the same wayfor I was minded to jump from the calche and run whilst they reared again and plunged madly so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting In a few minutes however my own ears got accustomed to the sound and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them He petted and soothed them and whispered something in their ears as I have heard of horsetamers doing and with extraordinary effect for under his caresses they became quite manageable again though they still trembled The driver again took his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace This time after going to the far side of the Pass he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right Soon we were hemmed in with trees which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side Though we were in shelter we could hear the rising wind for it moaned and whistled through the rocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along It grew colder and colder still and fine powdery snow began to fall so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs though this grew fainter as we went on our way The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer as though they were closing round on us from every side I grew dreadfully afraid and the horses shared my fear The driver however was not in the least disturbed he kept turning his head to left and right but I could not see anything through the darkness Suddenly away on our left I saw a faint flickering blue flame The driver saw it at the same moment he at once checked the horses and jumping to the ground disappeared into the darkness I did not know what to do the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word took his seat and we resumed our journey I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident for it seemed to be repeated endlessly and now looking back it is like a sort of awful nightmare Once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness around us I could watch the drivers motions He went rapidly to where the blue flame aroseit must have been very faint for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at alland gathering a few stones formed them into some device Once there appeared a strange optical effect when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same This startled me but as the effect was only momentary I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness Then for a time there were no blue flames and we sped onwards through the gloom with the howling of the wolves around us as though they were following in a moving circle At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright I could not see any cause for it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether but just then the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling pineclad rock and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves with white teeth and lolling red tongues with long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled For myself I felt a sort of paralysis of fear It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them The horses jumped about and reared and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side and they had perforce to remain within it I called to the coachman to come for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach I shouted and beat the side of the calche hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap How he came there I know not but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command and looking towards the sound saw him stand in the roadway As he swept his long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolves fell back and back further still Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon so that we were again in darkness When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calche and the wolves had disappeared This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me and I was afraid to speak or move The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way now in almost complete darkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon We kept on ascending with occasional periods of quick descent but in the main always ascending Suddenly I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came no ray of light and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky CHAPTER II JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNALcontinued 5 MayI must have been asleep for certainly if I had been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is I have not yet been able to see it by daylight When the calche stopped the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen Then he took out my traps and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door old and studded with large iron nails and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather As I stood the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins the horses started forward and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings I stood in silence where I was for I did not know what to do Of bell or knocker there was no sign through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate The time I waited seemed endless and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me What sort of place had I come to and among what kind of people What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitors clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner Solicitors clerk Mina would not like that Solicitorfor just before leaving London I got word that my examination was successful and I am now a fullblown solicitor I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me and I expected that I should suddenly awake and find myself at home with the dawn struggling in through the windows as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork But my flesh answered the pinching test and my eyes were not to be deceived I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians All I could do now was to be patient and to wait the coming of the morning Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse and the great door swung back Within stood a tall old man clean shaven save for a long white moustache and clad in black from head to foot without a single speck of colour about him anywhere He held in his hand an antique silver lamp in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture saying in excellent English but with a strange intonation Welcome to my house Enter freely and of your own will He made no motion of stepping to meet me but stood like a statue as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone The instant however that I had stepped over the threshold he moved impulsively forward and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as icemore like the hand of a dead than a living man Again he said Welcome to my house Come freely Go safely and leave something of the happiness you bring The strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which I had noticed in the driver whose face I had not seen that for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was speaking so to make sure I said interrogatively Count Dracula He bowed in a courtly way as he replied I am Dracula and I bid you welcome Mr Harker to my house Come in the night air is chill and you must need to eat and rest As he was speaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and stepping out took my luggage he had carried it in before I could forestall him I protested but he insisted Nay sir you are my guest It is late and my people are not available Let me see to your comfort myself He insisted on carrying my traps along the passage and then up a great winding stair and along another great passage on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily At the end of this he threw open a heavy door and I rejoiced to see within a welllit room in which a table was spread for supper and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs freshly replenished flamed and flared The Count halted putting down my bags closed the door and crossing the room opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp and seemingly without a window of any sort Passing through this he opened another door and motioned me to enter It was a welcome sight for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log firealso added to but lately for the top logs were freshwhich sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew saying before he closed the door You will need after your journey to refresh yourself by making your toilet I trust you will find all you wish When you are ready come into the other room where you will find your supper prepared The light and warmth and the Counts courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears Having then reached my normal state I discovered that I was half famished with hunger so making a hasty toilet I went into the other room I found supper already laid out My host who stood on one side of the great fireplace leaning against the stonework made a graceful wave of his hand to the table and said I pray you be seated and sup how you please You will I trust excuse me that I do not join you but I have dined already and I do not sup I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr Hawkins had entrusted to me He opened it and read it gravely then with a charming smile he handed it to me to read One passage of it at least gave me a thrill of pleasure I must regret that an attack of gout from which malady I am a constant sufferer forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute one in whom I have every possible confidence He is a young man full of energy and talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition He is discreet and silent and has grown into manhood in my service He shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall take your instructions in all matters The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish and I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken This with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay of which I had two glasses was my supper During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions as to my journey and I told him by degrees all I had experienced By this time I had finished my supper and by my hosts desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke I had now an opportunity of observing him and found him of a very marked physiognomy His face was a stronga very strongaquiline with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere His eyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion The mouth so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache was fixed and rather cruellooking with peculiarly sharp white teeth these protruded over the lips whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years For the rest his ears were pale and at the tops extremely pointed the chin was broad and strong and the cheeks firm though thin The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight and they had seemed rather white and fine but seeing them now close to me I could not but notice that they were rather coarsebroad with squat fingers Strange to say there were hairs in the centre of the palm The nails were long and fine and cut to a sharp point As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me I could not repress a shudder It may have been that his breath was rank but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what I would I could not conceal The Count evidently noticing it drew back and with a grim sort of smile which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace We were both silent for a while and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn There seemed a strange stillness over everything but as I listened I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves The Counts eyes gleamed and he said Listen to themthe children of the night What music they make Seeing I suppose some expression in my face strange to him he added Ah sir you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter Then he rose and said But you must be tired Your bedroom is all ready and tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will I have to be away till the afternoon so sleep well and dream well With a courteous bow he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room and I entered my bedroom I am all in a sea of wonders I doubt I fear I think strange things which I dare not confess to my own soul God keep me if only for the sake of those dear to me      7 MayIt is again early morning but I have rested and enjoyed the last twentyfour hours I slept till late in the day and awoke of my own accord When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had supped and found a cold breakfast laid out with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth There was a card on the table on which was written I have to be absent for a while Do not wait for meD I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal When I had done I looked for a bell so that I might let the servants know I had finished but I could not find one There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me The table service is of gold and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics and must have been of fabulous value when they were made for they are centuries old though in excellent order I saw something like them in Hampton Court but there they were worn and frayed and motheaten But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror There is not even a toilet glass on my table and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair I have not yet seen a servant anywhere or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves Some time after I had finished my mealI do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner for it was between five and six oclock when I had itI looked about for something to read for I did not like to go about the castle until I had asked the Counts permission There was absolutely nothing in the room book newspaper or even writing materials so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library The door opposite mine I tried but found it locked In the library I found to my great delight a vast number of English books whole shelves full of them and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers A table in the centre was littered with English magazines and newspapers though none of them were of very recent date The books were of the most varied kindhistory geography politics political economy botany geology lawall relating to England and English life and customs and manners There were even such books of reference as the London Directory the Red and Blue books Whitakers Almanac the Army and Navy Lists andit somehow gladdened my heart to see itthe Law List Whilst I was looking at the books the door opened and the Count entered He saluted me in a hearty way and hoped that I had had a good nights rest Then he went on I am glad you found your way in here for I am sure there is much that will interest you These companionsand he laid his hand on some of the bookshave been good friends to me and for some years past ever since I had the idea of going to London have given me many many hours of pleasure Through them I have come to know your great England and to know her is to love her I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity to share its life its change its death and all that makes it what it is But alas as yet I only know your tongue through books To you my friend I look that I know it to speak But Count I said you know and speak English thoroughly He bowed gravely I thank you my friend for your all tooflattering estimate but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel True I know the grammar and the words but yet I know not how to speak them Indeed I said you speak excellently Not so he answered Well I know that did I move and speak in your London none there are who would not know me for a stranger That is not enough for me Here I am noble I am boyar the common people know me and I am master But a stranger in a strange land he is no one men know him notand to know not is to care not for I am content if I am like the rest so that no man stops if he see me or pause in his speaking if he hear my words Ha ha a stranger I have been so long master that I would be master stillor at least that none other should be master of me You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins of Exeter to tell me all about my new estate in London You shall I trust rest here with me awhile so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation and I would that you tell me when I make error even of the smallest in my speaking I am sorry that I had to be away so long today but you will I know forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand Of course I said all I could about being willing and asked if I might come into that room when I chose He answered Yes certainly and added You may go anywhere you wish in the castle except where the doors are locked where of course you will not wish to go There is reason that all things are as they are and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge you would perhaps better understand I said I was sure of this and then he went on We are in Transylvania and Transylvania is not England Our ways are not your ways and there shall be to you many strange things Nay from what you have told me of your experiences already you know something of what strange things there may be This led to much conversation and as it was evident that he wanted to talk if only for talkings sake I asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice Sometimes he sheered off the subject or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand but generally he answered all I asked most frankly Then as time went on and I had got somewhat bolder I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night as for instance why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the yearlast night in fact when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked swaya blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed That treasure has been hidden he went on in the region through which you came last night there can be but little doubt for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian the Saxon and the Turk Why there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men patriots or invaders In old days there were stirring times when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes and the patriots went out to meet themmen and women the aged and the children tooand waited their coming on the rocks above the passes that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches When the invader was triumphant he found but little for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil But how said I can it have remained so long undiscovered when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look The Count smiled and as his lips ran back over his gums the long sharp canine teeth showed out strangely he answered Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool Those flames only appear on one night and on that night no man of this land will if he can help it stir without his doors And dear sir even if he did he would not know what to do Why even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work Even you would not I dare be sworn be able to find these places again There you are right I said I know no more than the dead where even to look for them Then we drifted into other matters Come he said at last tell me of London and of the house which you have procured for me With an apology for my remissness I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room and as I passed through noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit for it was by this time deep into the dark The lamps were also lit in the study or library and I found the Count lying on the sofa reading of all things in the world an English Bradshaws Guide When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts He was interested in everything and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did When I remarked this he answered Well but my friend is it not needful that I should When I go there I shall be all alone and my friend Harker Jonathannay pardon me I fall into my countrys habit of putting your patronymic firstmy friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me He will be in Exeter miles away probably working at papers of the law with my other friend Peter Hawkins So We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at Purfleet When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr Hawkins he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place I read to him the notes which I had made at the time and which I inscribe here At Purfleet on a byroad I came across just such a place as seemed to be required and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale It is surrounded by a high wall of ancient structure built of heavy stones and has not been repaired for a large number of years The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron all eaten with rust The estate is called Carfax no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre Face as the house is foursided agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass It contains in all some twenty acres quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned There are many trees on it which make it in places gloomy and there is a deep darklooking pond or small lake evidently fed by some springs as the water is clear and flows away in a fairsized stream The house is very large and of all periods back I should say to medival times for one part is of stone immensely thick with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron It looks like part of a keep and is close to an old chapel or church I could not enter it as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the house but I have taken with my kodak views of it from various points The house has been added to but in a very straggling way and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers which must be very great There are but few houses close at hand one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum It is not however visible from the grounds When I had finished he said I am glad that it is old and big I myself am of an old family and to live in a new house would kill me A house cannot be made habitable in a day and after all how few days go to make up a century I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead I seek not gaiety nor mirth not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay I am no longer young and my heart through weary years of mourning over the dead is not attuned to mirth Moreover the walls of my castle are broken the shadows are many and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements I love the shade and the shadow and would be alone with my thoughts when I may Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine Presently with an excuse he left me asking me to put all my papers together He was some little time away and I began to look at some of the books around me One was an atlas which I found opened naturally at England as if that map had been much used On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked and on examining these I noticed that one was near London on the east side manifestly where his new estate was situated the other two were Exeter and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned Aha he said still at your books Good But you must not work always Come I am informed that your supper is ready He took my arm and we went into the next room where I found an excellent supper ready on the table The Count again excused himself as he had dined out on his being away from home But he sat as on the previous night and chatted whilst I ate After supper I smoked as on the last evening and the Count stayed with me chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject hour after hour I felt that it was getting very late indeed but I did not say anything for I felt under obligation to meet my hosts wishes in every way I was not sleepy as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn which is like in its way the turn of the tide They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide any one who has when tired and tied as it were to his post experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air Count Dracula jumping to his feet said Why there is the morning again How remiss I am to let you stay up so long You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting so that I may not forget how time flies by us and with a courtly bow he quickly left me I went into my own room and drew the curtains but there was little to notice my window opened into the courtyard all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky So I pulled the curtains again and have written of this day      8 MayI began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too diffuse but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy I wish I were safe out of it or that I had never come It may be that this strange nightexistence is telling on me but would that that were all If there were any one to talk to I could bear it but there is no one I have only the Count to speak with and heI fear I am myself the only living soul within the place Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be it will help me to bear up and imagination must not run riot with me If it does I am lost Let me say at once how I standor seem to I only slept a few hours when I went to bed and feeling that I could not sleep any more got up I had hung my shaving glass by the window and was just beginning to shave Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the Counts voice saying to me Goodmorning I started for it amazed me that I had not seen him since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me In starting I had cut myself slightly but did not notice it at the moment Having answered the Counts salutation I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken This time there could be no error for the man was close to me and I could see him over my shoulder But there was no reflection of him in the mirror The whole room behind me was displayed but there was no sign of a man in it except myself This was startling and coming on the top of so many strange things was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near but at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little and the blood was trickling over my chin I laid down the razor turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster When the Count saw my face his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab at my throat I drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix It made an instant change in him for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there Take care he said take care how you cut yourself It is more dangerous than you think in this country Then seizing the shaving glass he went on And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief It is a foul bauble of mans vanity Away with it and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand he flung out the glass which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below Then he withdrew without a word It is very annoying for I do not see how I am to shave unless in my watchcase or the bottom of the shavingpot which is fortunately of metal When I went into the diningroom breakfast was prepared but I could not find the Count anywhere So I breakfasted alone It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink He must be a very peculiar man After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle I went out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the South The view was magnificent and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests But I am not in heart to describe beauty for when I had seen the view I explored further doors doors doors everywhere and all locked and bolted In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit The castle is a veritable prison and I am a prisoner CHAPTER III JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNALcontinued When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me I rushed up and down the stairs trying every door and peering out of every window I could find but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap When however the conviction had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietlyas quietly as I have ever done anything in my lifeand began to think over what was best to be done I am thinking still and as yet have come to no definite conclusion Of one thing only am I certain that it is no use making my ideas known to the Count He knows well that I am imprisoned and as he has done it himself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts So far as I can see my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself and my eyes open I am I know either being deceived like a baby by my own fears or else I am in desperate straits and if the latter be so I need and shall need all my brains to get through I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut and knew that the Count had returned He did not come at once into the library so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed This was odd but only confirmed what I had all along thoughtthat there were no servants in the house When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the diningroom I was assured of it for if he does himself all these menial offices surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them This gave me a fright for if there is no one else in the castle it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here This is a terrible thought for if so what does it mean that he could control the wolves as he did by only holding up his hand in silence How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me What meant the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash Bless that good good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself or that it is a medium a tangible help in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort Some time if it may be I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula as it may help me to understand Tonight he may talk of himself if I turn the conversation that way I must be very careful however not to awake his suspicion      MidnightI have had a long talk with the Count I asked him a few questions on Transylvania history and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully In his speaking of things and people and especially of battles he spoke as if he had been present at them all This he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride that their glory is his glory that their fate is his fate Whenever he spoke of his house he always said we and spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking I wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it for to me it was most fascinating It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country He grew excited as he spoke and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can for it tells in its way the story of his race We Szekelys have a right to be proud for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights for lordship Here in the whirlpool of European races the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe ay and of Asia and Africa too till the peoples thought that the werewolves themselves had come Here too when they came they found the Huns whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches who expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert Fools fools What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila whose blood is in these veins He held up his arms Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race that we were proud that when the Magyar the Lombard the Avar the Bulgar or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers we drove them back Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier that the Honfoglalas was completed there And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkeyland ay and more than that endless duty of the frontier guard for as the Turks say water sleeps and enemy is sleepless Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the bloody sword or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King When was redeemed that great shame of my nation the shame of Cassova when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground This was a Dracula indeed Woe was it that his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them Was it not this Dracula indeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkeyland who when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph They said that he thought only of himself Bah what good are peasants without a leader Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it Again when after the battle of Mohcs we threw off the Hungarian yoke we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders for our spirit would not brook that we were not free Ah young sir the Szekelysand the Dracula as their hearts blood their brains and their swordscan boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach The warlike days are over Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told It was by this time close on morning and we went to bed Mem this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the Arabian Nights for everything has to break off at cockcrowor like the ghost of Hamlets father      12 MayLet me begin with factsbare meagre facts verified by books and figures and of which there can be no doubt I must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation or my memory of them Last evening when the Count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business I had spent the day wearily over books and simply to keep my mind occupied went over some of the matters I had been examining at Lincolns Inn There was a certain method in the Counts inquiries so I shall try to put them down in sequence the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me First he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more I told him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction as only one could act at a time and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest He seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend say to banking and another to look after shipping in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor I asked him to explain more fully so that I might not by any chance mislead him so he said I shall illustrate Your friend and mine Mr Peter Hawkins from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter which is far from London buys for me through your good self my place at London Good Now here let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one resident there that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only and as one of London residence might perhaps have some purpose of himself or friend to serve I went thus afield to seek my agent whose labours should be only to my interest Now suppose I who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to Newcastle or Durham or Harwich or Dover might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports I answered that certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor so that the client simply placing himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble But said he I could be at liberty to direct myself Is it not so Of course I replied and such is often done by men of business who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person Good he said and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise but by forethought could be guarded against I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee For a man who was never in the country and who did not evidently do much in the way of business his knowledge and acumen were wonderful When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken and I had verified all as well as I could by the books available he suddenly stood up and said Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr Peter Hawkins or to any other It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody Then write now my young friend he said laying a heavy hand on my shoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it will please you that you shall stay with me until a month from now Do you wish me to stay so long I asked for my heart grew cold at the thought I desire it much nay I will take no refusal When your master employer what you will engaged that someone should come on his behalf it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted I have not stinted Is it not so What could I do but bow acceptance It was Mr Hawkinss interest not mine and I had to think of him not myself and besides while Count Dracula was speaking there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner and that if I wished it I could have no choice The Count saw his victory in my bow and his mastery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to use them but in his own smooth resistless way I pray you my good young friend that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well and that you look forward to getting home to them Is it not so As he spoke he handed me three sheets of notepaper and three envelopes They were all of the thinnest foreign post and looking at them then at him and noticing his quiet smile with the sharp canine teeth lying over the red underlip I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote for he would be able to read it So I determined to write only formal notes now but to write fully to Mr Hawkins in secret and also to Mina for to her I could write in shorthand which would puzzle the Count if he did see it When I had written my two letters I sat quiet reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes referring as he wrote them to some books on his table Then he took up my two and placed them with his own and put by his writing materials after which the instant the door had closed behind him I leaned over and looked at the letters which were face down on the table I felt no compunction in doing so for under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I could One of the letters was directed to Samuel F Billington No 7 The Crescent Whitby another to Herr Leutner Varna the third was to Coutts  Co London and the fourth to Herren Klopstock  Billreuth bankers BudaPesth The second and fourth were unsealed I was just about to look at them when I saw the doorhandle move I sank back in my seat having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the Count holding still another letter in his hand entered the room He took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully and then turning to me said I trust you will forgive me but I have much work to do in private this evening You will I hope find all things as you wish At the door he turned and after a moments pause said Let me advise you my dear young friendnay let me warn you with all seriousness that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle It is old and has many memories and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely Be warned Should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms for your rest will then be safe But if you be not careful in this respect thenHe finished his speech in a gruesome way for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them I quite understood my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me      LaterI endorse the last words written but this time there is no doubt in question I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bedI imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams and there it shall remain When he left me I went to my room After a little while not hearing any sound I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse inaccessible though it was to me as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard Looking out on this I felt that I was indeed in prison and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air though it were of the night I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me It is destroying my nerve I start at my own shadow and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place I looked out over the beautiful expanse bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day In the soft light the distant hills became melted and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness The mere beauty seemed to cheer me there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me and somewhat to my left where I imagined from the order of the rooms that the windows of the Counts own room would look out The window at which I stood was tall and deep stonemullioned and though weatherworn was still complete but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there I drew back behind the stonework and looked carefully out What I saw was the Counts head coming out from the window I did not see the face but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying I was at first interested and somewhat amused for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings At first I could not believe my eyes I thought it was some trick of the moonlight some weird effect of shadow but I kept looking and it could be no delusion I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed just as a lizard moves along a wall What manner of man is this or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me I am in fearin awful fearand there is no escape for me I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of      15 MayOnce more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion He moved downwards in a sidelong way some hundred feet down and a good deal to the left He vanished into some hole or window When his head had disappeared I leaned out to try and see more but without availthe distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight I knew he had left the castle now and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet I went back to the room and taking a lamp tried all the doors They were all locked as I had expected and the locks were comparatively new but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains but the door was locked and the key was gone That key must be in the Counts room I must watch should his door be unlocked so that I may get it and escape I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages and to try the doors that opened from them One or two small rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture dusty with age and motheaten At last however I found one door at the top of the stairway which though it seemed to be locked gave a little under pressure I tried it harder and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rested on the floor Here was an opportunity which I might not have again so I exerted myself and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle the windows of the end room looking out both west and south On the latter side as well as to the former there was a great precipice The castle was built on the corner of a great rock so that on three sides it was quite impregnable and great windows were placed here where sling or bow or culverin could not reach and consequently light and comfort impossible to a position which had to be guarded were secured To the west was a great valley and then rising far away great jagged mountain fastnesses rising peak on peak the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days for the furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen The windows were curtainless and the yellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond panes enabled one to see even colours whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but I was glad to have it with me for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble Still it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count and after trying a little to school my nerves I found a soft quietude come over me Here I am sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen with much thought and many blushes her illspelt loveletter and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last It is nineteenth century uptodate with a vengeance And yet unless my senses deceive me the old centuries had and have powers of their own which mere modernity cannot kill      Later the Morning of 16 MayGod preserve my sanity for to this I am reduced Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for that I may not go mad if indeed I be not mad already If I be sane then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me that to him alone I can look for safety even though this be only whilst I can serve his purpose Great God merciful God Let me be calm for out of that way lies madness indeed I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say My tablets quick my tablets Tis meet that I put it down etc for now feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing I turn to my diary for repose The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me The Counts mysterious warning frightened me at the time it frightens me more now when I think of it for in future he has a fearful hold upon me I shall fear to doubt what he may say When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy The Counts warning came into my mind but I took a pleasure in disobeying it The sense of sleep was upon me and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider The soft moonlight soothed and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me I determined not to return tonight to the gloomhaunted rooms but to sleep here where of old ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner so that as I lay I could look at the lovely view to east and south and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust composed myself for sleep I suppose I must have fallen asleep I hope so but I fear for all that followed was startlingly realso real that now sitting here in the broad full sunlight of the morning I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep I was not alone The room was the same unchanged in any way since I came into it I could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust In the moonlight opposite me were three young women ladies by their dress and manner I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them for though the moonlight was behind them they threw no shadow on the floor They came close to me and looked at me for some time and then whispered together Two were dark and had high aquiline noses like the Count and great dark piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon The other was fair as fair as can be with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires I seemed somehow to know her face and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear but I could not recollect at the moment how or where All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips There was something about them that made me uneasy some longing and at the same time some deadly fear I felt in my heart a wicked burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips It is not good to note this down lest some day it should meet Minas eyes and cause her pain but it is the truth They whispered together and then they all three laughedsuch a silvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips It was like the intolerable tingling sweetness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning hand The fair girl shook her head coquettishly and the other two urged her on One said Go on You are first and we shall follow yours is the right to begin The other added He is young and strong there are kisses for us all I lay quiet looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me Sweet it was in one sense honeysweet and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice but with a bitter underlying the sweet a bitter offensiveness as one smells in blood I was afraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes The girl went on her knees and bent over me simply gloating There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat Then she paused and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips and could feel the hot breath on my neck Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as ones flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearernearer I could feel the soft shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat and the hard dents of two sharp teeth just touching and pausing there I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waitedwaited with beating heart But at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning I was conscious of the presence of the Count and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giants power draw it back the blue eyes transformed with fury the white teeth champing with rage and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion But the Count Never did I imagine such wrath and fury even to the demons of the pit His eyes were positively blazing The red light in them was lurid as if the flames of hellfire blazed behind them His face was deathly pale and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of whitehot metal With a fierce sweep of his arm he hurled the woman from him and then motioned to the others as though he were beating them back it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves In a voice which though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said How dare you touch him any of you How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it Back I tell you all This man belongs to me Beware how you meddle with him or youll have to deal with me The fair girl with a laugh of ribald coquetry turned to answer him You yourself never loved you never love On this the other women joined and such a mirthless hard soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear it seemed like the pleasure of fiends Then the Count turned after looking at my face attentively and said in a soft whisper Yes I too can love you yourselves can tell it from the past Is it not so Well now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss him at your will Now go go I must awaken him for there is work to be done Are we to have nothing tonight said one of them with a low laugh as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and which moved as though there were some living thing within it For answer he nodded his head One of the women jumped forward and opened it If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail as of a halfsmothered child The women closed round whilst I was aghast with horror but as I looked they disappeared and with them the dreadful bag There was no door near them and they could not have passed me without my noticing They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window for I could see outside the dim shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away Then the horror overcame me and I sank down unconscious CHAPTER IV JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNALcontinued I awoke in my own bed If it be that I had not dreamt the Count must have carried me here I tried to satisfy myself on the subject but could not arrive at any unquestionable result To be sure there were certain small evidences such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit My watch was still unwound and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed and many such details But these things are no proof for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual and from some cause or another I had certainly been much upset I must watch for proof Of one thing I am glad if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed me he must have been hurried in his task for my pockets are intact I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked He would have taken or destroyed it As I look round this room although it has been to me so full of fear it is now a sort of sanctuary for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women who werewho arewaiting to suck my blood      18 MayI have been down to look at that room again in daylight for I must know the truth When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs I found it closed It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered I could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot but the door is fastened from the inside I fear it was no dream and must act on this surmise      19 MayI am surely in the toils Last night the Count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters one saying that my work here was nearly done and that I should start for home within a few days another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz I would fain have rebelled but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger He knows that I know too much and that I must not live lest I be dangerous to him my only chance is to prolong my opportunities Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion I therefore pretended to fall in with his views and asked him what dates I should put on the letters He calculated a minute and then said The first should be June 12 the second June 19 and the third June 29 I know now the span of my life God help me      28 MayThere is a chance of escape or at any rate of being able to send word home A band of Szgany have come to the castle and are encamped in the courtyard These Szgany are gipsies I have notes of them in my book They are peculiar to this part of the world though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania who are almost outside all law They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar and call themselves by his name They are fearless and without religion save superstition and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany tongue I shall write some letters home and shall try to get them to have them posted I have already spoken them through my window to begin acquaintanceship They took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs which however I could not understand any more than I could their spoken language      I have written the letters Minas is in shorthand and I simply ask Mr Hawkins to communicate with her To her I have explained my situation but without the horrors which I may only surmise It would shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her Should the letters not carry then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge      I have given the letters I threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece and made what signs I could to have them posted The man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed and then put them in his cap I could do no more I stole back to the study and began to read As the Count did not come in I have written here      The Count has come He sat down beside me and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters The Szgany has given me these of which though I know not whence they come I shall of course take care Seehe must have looked at itone is from you and to my friend Peter Hawkins the otherhere he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope and the dark look came into his face and his eyes blazed wickedlythe other is a vile thing an outrage upon friendship and hospitality It is not signed Well so it cannot matter to us And he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed Then he went on The letter to Hawkinsthat I shall of course send on since it is yours Your letters are sacred to me Your pardon my friend that unknowingly I did break the seal Will you not cover it again He held out the letter to me and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence When he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly A minute later I went over and tried it and the door was locked When an hour or two after the Count came quietly into the room his coming awakened me for I had gone to sleep on the sofa He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner and seeing that I had been sleeping he said So my friend you are tired Get to bed There is the surest rest I may not have the pleasure to talk tonight since there are many labours to me but you will sleep I pray I passed to my room and went to bed and strange to say slept without dreaming Despair has its own calms      31 MayThis morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket so that I might write in case I should get an opportunity but again a surprise again a shock Every scrap of paper was gone and with it all my notes my memoranda relating to railways and travel my letter of credit in fact all that might be useful to me were I once outside the castle I sat and pondered awhile and then some thought occurred to me and I made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes The suit in which I had travelled was gone and also my overcoat and rug I could find no trace of them anywhere This looked like some new scheme of villainy      17 JuneThis morning as I was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard With joy I hurried to the window and saw drive into the yard two great leiterwagons each drawn by eight sturdy horses and at the head of each pair a Slovak with his wide hat great nailstudded belt dirty sheepskin and high boots They had also their long staves in hand I ran to the door intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall as I thought that way might be opened for them Again a shock my door was fastened on the outside Then I ran to the window and cried to them They looked up at me stupidly and pointed but just then the hetman of the Szgany came out and seeing them pointing to my window said something at which they laughed Henceforth no effort of mine no piteous cry or agonised entreaty would make them even look at me They resolutely turned away The leiterwagons contained great square boxes with handles of thick rope these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them and by their resonance as they were roughly moved When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany and spitting on it for luck lazily went each to his horses head Shortly afterwards I heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance      24 June before morningLast night the Count left me early and locked himself into his own room As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair and looked out of the window which opened south I thought I would watch for the Count for there is something going on The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind I know it for now and then I hear a faraway muffled sound as of mattock and spade and whatever it is it must be the end of some ruthless villainy I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour when I saw something coming out of the Counts window I drew back and watched carefully and saw the whole man emerge It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away There could be no doubt as to his quest and in my garb too This then is his new scheme of evil that he will allow others to see me as they think so that he may both leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me It makes me rage to think that this can go on and whilst I am shut up here a veritable prisoner but without that protection of the law which is even a criminals right and consolation I thought I would watch for the Counts return and for a long time sat doggedly at the window Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight They were like the tiniest grains of dust and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way I watched them with a sense of soothing and a sort of calm stole over me I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position so that I could enjoy more fully the arial gambolling Something made me start up a low piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley which was hidden from my sight Louder it seemed to ring in my ears and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts nay my very soul was struggling and my halfremembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call I was becoming hypnotised Quicker and quicker danced the dust the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes And then I started broad awake and in full possession of my senses and ran screaming from the place The phantom shapes which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed I fled and felt somewhat safer in my own room where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the Counts room something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed and then there was silence deep awful silence which chilled me With a beating heart I tried the door but I was locked in my prison and could do nothing I sat down and simply cried As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard withoutthe agonised cry of a woman I rushed to the window and throwing it up peered out between the bars There indeed was a woman with dishevelled hair holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running She was leaning against a corner of the gateway When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward and shouted in a voice laden with menace Monster give me my child She threw herself on her knees and raising up her hands cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart Then she tore her hair and beat her breast and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion Finally she threw herself forward and though I could not see her I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door Somewhere high overhead probably on the tower I heard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh metallic whisper His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured like a pentup dam when liberated through the wide entrance into the courtyard There was no cry from the woman and the howling of the wolves was but short Before long they streamed away singly licking their lips I could not pity her for I knew now what had become of her child and she was better dead What shall I do what can I do How can I escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear      25 June morningNo man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me Last night one of my postdated letters went to post the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth Let me not think of it Action It has always been at nighttime that I have been molested or threatened or in some way in danger or in fear I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight Can it be that he sleeps when others wake that he may be awake whilst they sleep If I could only get into his room But there is no possible way The door is always locked no way for me Yes there is a way if one dares to take it Where his body has gone why may not another body go I have seen him myself crawl from his window Why should not I imitate him and go in by his window The chances are desperate but my need is more desperate still I shall risk it At the worst it can only be death and a mans death is not a calfs and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me God help me in my task Goodbye Mina if I fail goodbye my faithful friend and second father goodbye all and last of all Mina      Same day laterI have made the effort and God helping me have come safely back to this room I must put down every detail in order I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side The stones are big and roughly cut and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them I took off my boots and ventured out on the desperate way I looked down once so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me but after that kept my eyes away from it I knew pretty well the direction and distance of the Counts window and made for it as well as I could having regard to the opportunities available I did not feel dizzyI suppose I was too excitedand the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the windowsill and trying to raise up the sash I was filled with agitation however when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window Then I looked around for the Count but with surprise and gladness made a discovery The room was empty It was barely furnished with odd things which seemed to have never been used the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms and was covered with dust I looked for the key but it was not in the lock and I could not find it anywhere The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one cornergold of all kinds Roman and British and Austrian and Hungarian and Greek and Turkish money covered with a film of dust as though it had lain long in the ground None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old There were also chains and ornaments some jewelled but all of them old and stained At one corner of the room was a heavy door I tried it for since I could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door which was the main object of my search I must make further examination or all my efforts would be in vain It was open and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway which went steeply down I descended minding carefully where I went for the stairs were dark being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry At the bottom there was a dark tunnellike passage through which came a deathly sickly odour the odour of old earth newly turned As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar and found myself in an old ruined chapel which had evidently been used as a graveyard The roof was broken and in two places were steps leading to vaults but the ground had recently been dug over and the earth placed in great wooden boxes manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks There was nobody about and I made search for any further outlet but there was none Then I went over every inch of the ground so as not to lose a chance I went down even into the vaults where the dim light struggled although to do so was a dread to my very soul Into two of these I went but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust in the third however I made a discovery There in one of the great boxes of which there were fifty in all on a pile of newly dug earth lay the Count He was either dead or asleep I could not say whichfor the eyes were open and stony but without the glassiness of deathand the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor the lips were as red as ever But there was no sign of movement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart I bent over him and tried to find any sign of life but in vain He could not have lain there long for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours By the side of the box was its cover pierced with holes here and there I thought he might have the keys on him but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes and in them dead though they were such a look of hate though unconscious of me or my presence that I fled from the place and leaving the Counts room by the window crawled again up the castle wall Regaining my room I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think      29 JuneToday is the date of my last letter and the Count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine for again I saw him leave the castle by the same window and in my clothes As he went down the wall lizard fashion I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon that I might destroy him but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by mans hand would have any effect on him I dared not wait to see him return for I feared to see those weird sisters I came back to the library and read there till I fell asleep I was awakened by the Count who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said Tomorrow my friend we must part You return to your beautiful England I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet Your letter home has been despatched tomorrow I shall not be here but all shall be ready for your journey In the morning come the Szgany who have some labours of their own here and also come some Slovaks When they have gone my carriage shall come for you and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula I suspected him and determined to test his sincerity Sincerity It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster so asked him pointblank Why may I not go tonight Because dear sir my coachman and horses are away on a mission But I would walk with pleasure I want to get away at once He smiled such a soft smooth diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness He said And your baggage I do not care about it I can send for it some other time The Count stood up and said with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes it seemed so real You English have a saying which is close to my heart for its spirit is that which rules our boyars Welcome the coming speed the parting guest Come with me my dear young friend Not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will though sad am I at your going and that you so suddenly desire it Come With a stately gravity he with the lamp preceded me down the stairs and along the hall Suddenly he stopped Hark Close at hand came the howling of many wolves It was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bton of the conductor After a pause of a moment he proceeded in his stately way to the door drew back the ponderous bolts unhooked the heavy chains and began to draw it open To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked Suspiciously I looked all round but could see no key of any kind As the door began to open the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier their red jaws with champing teeth and their bluntclawed feet as they leaped came in through the opening door I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless With such allies as these at his command I could do nothing But still the door continued slowly to open and only the Counts body stood in the gap Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom I was to be given to the wolves and at my own instigation There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count and as a last chance I cried out Shut the door I shall wait till morning and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment With one sweep of his powerful arm the Count threw the door shut and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places In silence we returned to the library and after a minute or two I went to my own room The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me with a red light of triumph in his eyes and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of When I was in my room and about to lie down I thought I heard a whispering at my door I went to it softly and listened Unless my ears deceived me I heard the voice of the Count Back back to your own place Your time is not yet come Wait Have patience Tonight is mine Tomorrow night is yours There was a low sweet ripple of laughter and in a rage I threw open the door and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips As I appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh and ran away I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees It is then so near the end Tomorrow tomorrow Lord help me and those to whom I am dear      30 June morningThese may be the last words I ever write in this diary I slept till just before the dawn and when I woke threw myself on my knees for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready At last I felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morning had come Then came the welcome cockcrow and I felt that I was safe With a glad heart I opened my door and ran down to the hall I had seen that the door was unlocked and now escape was before me With hands that trembled with eagerness I unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts But the door would not move Despair seized me I pulled and pulled at the door and shook it till massive as it was it rattled in its casement I could see the bolt shot It had been locked after I left the Count Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk and I determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Counts room He might kill me but death now seemed the happier choice of evils Without a pause I rushed up to the east window and scrambled down the wall as before into the Counts room It was empty but that was as I expected I could not see a key anywhere but the heap of gold remained I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought The great box was in the same place close against the wall but the lid was laid on it not fastened down but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home I knew I must reach the body for the key so I raised the lid and laid it back against the wall and then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror There lay the Count but looking as if his youth had been half renewed for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark irongrey the cheeks were fuller and the white skin seemed rubyred underneath the mouth was redder than ever for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck Even the deep burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood He lay like a filthy leech exhausted with his repletion I shuddered as I bent over to touch him and every sense in me revolted at the contact but I had to search or I was lost The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three I felt all over the body but no sign could I find of the key Then I stopped and looked at the Count There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad This was the being I was helping to transfer to London where perhaps for centuries to come he might amongst its teeming millions satiate his lust for blood and create a new and everwidening circle of semidemons to batten on the helpless The very thought drove me mad A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster There was no lethal weapon at hand but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases and lifting it high struck with the edge downward at the hateful face But as I did so the head turned and the eyes fell full upon me with all their blaze of basilisk horror The sight seemed to paralyse me and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face merely making a deep gash above the forehead The shovel fell from my hand across the box and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again and hid the horrid thing from my sight The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face bloodstained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell I thought and thought what should be my next move but my brain seemed on fire and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body I ran from the place and gained the Counts room determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened With strained ears I listened and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door There must have been some other means of entry or some one had a key for one of the locked doors Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo I turned to run down again towards the vault where I might find the new entrance but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying When I ran to push it open I found that it was hopelessly fast I was again a prisoner and the net of doom was closing round me more closely As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily doubtless the boxes with their freight of earth There is a sound of hammering it is the box being nailed down Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall with many other idle feet coming behind them The door is shut and the chains rattle there is a grinding of the key in the lock I can hear the key withdraw then another door opens and shuts I hear the creaking of lock and bolt Hark in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels the crack of whips and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the distance I am alone in the castle with those awful women Faugh Mina is a woman and there is nought in common They are devils of the Pit I shall not remain alone with them I shall try to scale the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted I shall take some of the gold with me lest I want it later I may find a way from this dreadful place And then away for home away to the quickest and nearest train away from this cursed spot from this cursed land where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet At least Gods mercy is better than that of these monsters and the precipice is steep and high At its foot a man may sleepas a man Goodbye all Mina CHAPTER V Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra 9 May My dearest Lucy Forgive my long delay in writing but I have been simply overwhelmed with work The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying I am longing to be with you and by the sea where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air I have been working very hard lately because I want to keep up with Jonathans studies and I have been practising shorthand very assiduously When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter at which also I am practising very hard He and I sometimes write letters in shorthand and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad When I am with you I shall keep a diary in the same way I dont mean one of those twopagestotheweekwithSundaysqueezedinacorner diaries but a sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined I do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people but it is not intended for them I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing but it is really an exercise book I shall try to do what I see lady journalists do interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations I am told that with a little practice one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day However we shall see I will tell you of my little plans when we meet I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania He is well and will be returning in about a week I am longing to hear all his news It must be so nice to see strange countries I wonder if weI mean Jonathan and Ishall ever see them together There is the ten oclock bell ringing Goodbye Your loving MINA Tell me all the news when you write You have not told me anything for a long time I hear rumours and especially of a tall handsome curlyhaired man Letter Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray 17 Chatham Street Wednesday My dearest Mina I must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent I wrote to you twice since we parted and your last letter was only your second Besides I have nothing to tell you There is really nothing to interest you Town is very pleasant just now and we go a good deal to picturegalleries and for walks and rides in the park As to the tall curlyhaired man I suppose it was the one who was with me at the last Pop Some one has evidently been telling tales That was Mr Holmwood He often comes to see us and he and mamma get on very well together they have so many things to talk about in common We met some time ago a man that would just do for you if you were not already engaged to Jonathan He is an excellent parti being handsome well off and of good birth He is a doctor and really clever Just fancy He is only nineandtwenty and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care Mr Holmwood introduced him to me and he called here to see us and often comes now I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever saw and yet the most calm He seems absolutely imperturbable I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face as if trying to read ones thoughts He tries this on very much with me but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack I know that from my glass Do you ever try to read your own face I do and I can tell you it is not a bad study and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it He says that I afford him a curious psychological study and I humbly think I do I do not as you know take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions Dress is a bore That is slang again but never mind Arthur says that every day There it is all out Mina we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children we have slept together and eaten together and laughed and cried together and now though I have spoken I would like to speak more Oh Mina couldnt you guess I love him I am blushing as I write for although I think he loves me he has not told me so in words But oh Mina I love him I love him I love him There that does me good I wish I were with you dear sitting by the fire undressing as we used to sit and I would try to tell you what I feel I do not know how I am writing this even to you I am afraid to stop or I should tear up the letter and I dont want to stop for I do so want to tell you all Let me hear from you at once and tell me all that you think about it Mina I must stop Goodnight Bless me in your prayers and Mina pray for my happiness LUCY PSI need not tell you this is a secret Goodnight again L Letter Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray 24 May My dearest Mina Thanks and thanks and thanks again for your sweet letter It was so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy My dear it never rains but it pours How true the old proverbs are Here am I who shall be twenty in September and yet I never had a proposal till today not a real proposal and today I have had three Just fancy THREE proposals in one day Isnt it awful I feel sorry really and truly sorry for two of the poor fellows Oh Mina I am so happy that I dont know what to do with myself And three proposals But for goodness sake dont tell any of the girls or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least Some girls are so vain You and I Mina dear who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women can despise vanity Well I must tell you about the three but you must keep it a secret dear from every one except of course Jonathan You will tell him because I would if I were in your place certainly tell Arthur A woman ought to tell her husband everythingdont you think so dearand I must be fair Men like women certainly their wives to be quite as fair as they are and women I am afraid are not always quite as fair as they should be Well my dear number One came just before lunch I told you of him Dr John Seward the lunaticasylum man with the strong jaw and the good forehead He was very cool outwardly but was nervous all the same He had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things and remembered them but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat which men dont generally do when they are cool and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream He spoke to me Mina very straightforwardly He told me how dear I was to him though he had known me so little and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time and when I shook my head his hands trembled and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else He put it very nicely saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me but only to know because if a womans heart was free a man might have hope And then Mina I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one I only told him that much and then he stood up and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy and that if I ever wanted a friend I must count him one of my best Oh Mina dear I cant help crying and you must excuse this letter being all blotted Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing but it isnt at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow whom you know loves you honestly going away and looking all brokenhearted and to know that no matter what he may say at the moment you are passing quite out of his life My dear I must stop here at present I feel so miserable though I am so happy Evening Arthur has just gone and I feel in better spirits than when I left off so I can go on telling you about the day Well my dear number Two came after lunch He is such a nice fellow an American from Texas and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has had such adventures I sympathise with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear even by a black man I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears and we marry him I know now what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me No I dont for there was Mr Morris telling us his stories and Arthur never told any and yet My dear I am somewhat previous Mr Quincey P Morris found me alone It seems that a man always does find a girl alone No he doesnt for Arthur tried twice to make a chance and I helping him all I could I am not ashamed to say it now I must tell you beforehand that Mr Morris doesnt always speak slangthat is to say he never does so to strangers or before them for he is really well educated and has exquisite mannersbut he found out that it amused me to hear him talk American slang and whenever I was present and there was no one to be shocked he said such funny things I am afraid my dear he has to invent it all for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say But this is a way slang has I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang I do not know if Arthur likes it as I have never heard him use any as yet Well Mr Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could but I could see all the same that he was very nervous He took my hand in his and said ever so sweetly Miss Lucy I know I aint good enough to regulate the fixins of your little shoes but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit Wont you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together driving in double harness Well he did look so goodhumoured and so jolly that it didnt seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr Seward so I said as lightly as I could that I did not know anything of hitching and that I wasnt broken to harness at all yet Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave so momentous an occasion for him I would forgive him He really did look serious when he was saying it and I couldnt help feeling a bit serious tooI know Mina you will think me a horrid flirtthough I couldnt help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day And then my dear before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of lovemaking laying his very heart and soul at my feet He looked so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be playful always and never earnest because he is merry at times I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him for he suddenly stopped and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free Lucy you are an honesthearted girl I know I should not be here speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit right through to the very depths of your soul Tell me like one good fellow to another is there any one else that you care for And if there is Ill never trouble you a hairs breadth again but will be if you will let me a very faithful friend My dear Mina why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them Here was I almost making fun of this greathearted true gentleman I burst into tearsI am afraid my dear you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than oneand I really felt very badly Why cant they let a girl marry three men or as many as want her and save all this trouble But this is heresy and I must not say it I am glad to say that though I was crying I was able to look into Mr Morriss brave eyes and I told him out straight Yes there is some one I love though he has not told me yet that he even loves me I was right to speak to him so frankly for quite a light came into his face and he put out both his hands and took mineI think I put them into hisand said in a hearty way Thats my brave girl Its better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world Dont cry my dear If its for me Im a hard nut to crack and I take it standing up If that other fellow doesnt know his happiness well hed better look for it soon or hell have to deal with me Little girl your honesty and pluck have made me a friend and thats rarer than a lover its more unselfish anyhow My dear Im going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come Wont you give me one kiss Itll be something to keep off the darkness now and then You can you know if you like for that other good fellowhe must be a good fellow my dear and a fine fellow or you could not love himhasnt spoken yet That quite won me Mina for it was brave and sweet of him and noble too to a rivalwasnt itand he so sad so I leant over and kissed him He stood up with my two hands in his and as he looked down into my faceI am afraid I was blushing very muchhe said Little girl I hold your hand and youve kissed me and if these things dont make us friends nothing ever will Thank you for your sweet honesty to me and goodbye He wrung my hand and taking up his hat went straight out of the room without looking back without a tear or a quiver or a pause and I am crying like a baby Oh why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on I know I would if I were freeonly I dont want to be free My dear this quite upset me and I feel I cannot write of happiness just at once after telling you of it and I dont wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy Ever your loving LUCY PSOh about number ThreeI neednt tell you of number Three need I Besides it was all so confused it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me and he was kissing me I am very very happy and I dont know what I have done to deserve it I must only try in the future to show that I am not ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a lover such a husband and such a friend Goodbye Dr Sewards Diary Kept in phonograph 25 MayEbb tide in appetite today Cannot eat cannot rest so diary instead Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work I went down amongst the patients I picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest He is so quaint that I am determined to understand him as well as I can Today I seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery I questioned him more fully than I had ever done with a view to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination In my manner of doing it there was I now see something of cruelty I seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madnessa thing which I avoid with the patients as I would the mouth of hell Mem under what circumstances would I not avoid the pit of hell Omnia Rom venalia sunt Hell has its price verb sap If there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards accurately so I had better commence to do so therefore R M Renfield tat 59Sanguine temperament great physical strength morbidly excitable periods of gloom ending in some fixed idea which I cannot make out I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence

point is when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal when duty a cause etc is the fixed point the latter force is paramount and only accident or a series of

Marquesas and drunk healths on the shore of Titicaca There are more yarns to be told and other wounds to be healed and another health to be drunk Wont you let this be at my campfire tomorrow night I have no hesitation in asking you as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinnerparty and that you are free There will only be one other our old pal at the Korea Jack Seward Hes coming too and we both want to mingle our weeps over the winecup and to drink a health with all our hearts to the happiest man in all the wide world who has won the noblest heart that God has made and the best worth winning We promise you a hearty welcome and a loving greeting and a health as true as your own right hand We shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep to a certain pair of eyes Come

MURRAYS JOURNAL 24 July WhitbyLucy met me at the station looking sweeter and lovelier than ever and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms This is a lovely place The little river the Esk runs through a deep valley which broadens out as it comes near the harbour A great viaduct runs across with high piers through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is The valley is beautifully green and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it unless you are near enough to see down The houses of the old townthe side away from usare all redroofed and seem piled up one over the other anyhow like the pictures we see of Nuremberg Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abbey which was sacked by the Danes and which is the scene of part of Marmion where the girl was built up in the wall It is a most noble ruin of immense size and full of beautiful and romantic bits there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows Between it and the town there is another church the parish one round which is a big graveyard all full of tombstones This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby for it lies right over the town and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away and some of the graves have been destroyed In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below There are walks with seats beside them through the churchyard and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze I shall come and sit here very often myself and work Indeed I am writing now with my book on my knee and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk The harbour lies below me with on the far side one long granite wall stretching out into the sea with a curve outwards at the end of it in the middle of which is a lighthouse A heavy seawall runs along outside of it On the near side the seawall makes an elbow crooked inversely and its end too has a lighthouse Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour which then suddenly widens It is nice at high water but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing and there is merely the stream of the Esk running between banks of sand with rocks here and there Outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse At the end of it is a buoy with a bell which swings in bad weather and sends in a mournful sound on the wind They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea I must ask the old man about this he is coming this way He is a funny old man He must be awfully old for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree He tells me that he is nearly a hundred and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought He is I am afraid a very sceptical person for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady at the abbey he said very brusquely I wouldnt fash masel about them miss Them things be all wore out Mind I dont say that they never was but I do say that they wasnt in my time They be all very well for comers and trippers an the like but not for a nice young lady like you Them feetfolks from York and Leeds that be always eatin cured herrins an drinkin tea an lookin out to buy cheap jet would creed aught I wonder masel whod be bothered tellin lies to themeven the newspapers which is full of fooltalk I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whalefishing in the old days He was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six whereupon he laboured to get up and said I must gang ageeanwards home now miss My granddaughter doesnt like to be kept waitin when the tea is ready for it takes me time to crammle aboon the grees for there be a many of em an miss I lack bellytimber sairly by the clock He hobbled away and I could see him hurrying as well as he could down the steps The steps are a great feature on the place They lead from the town up to the church there are hundreds of themI do not know how manyand they wind up in a delicate curve the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them I think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey I shall go home too Lucy went out visiting with her mother and as they were only duty calls I did not go They will be home by this      1 AugustI came up here an hour ago with Lucy and we had a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them and I should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person He will not admit anything and downfaces everybody If he cant outargue them he bullies them and then takes their silence for agreement with his views Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down She is so sweet with old people I think they all fell in love with her on the spot Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her but gave me double share instead I got him on the subject of the legends and he went off at once into a sort of sermon I must try to remember it and put it down It be all fooltalk lock stock and barrel thats what it be an nowt else These bans an wafts an bohghosts an barguests an bogles an all anent them is only fit to set bairns an dizzy women abelderin They be nowt but airblebs They an all grims an signs an warnins be all invented by

approval of his cronies that he was showing off so I put in a word to keep him going Oh Mr Swales you cant be serious Surely these tombstones are not all wrong Yabblins There may be a poorish few not

John Paxton drowned off Cape Farewell a year later or old John Rawlings whose grandfather sailed with me drowned in the Gulf of Finland in 50 Do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds I have me antherums aboot it I tell ye that when they got here theyd be jommlin an jostlin one another that way that it ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days when wed be at one another from daylight to dark an tryin to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis This was evidently local pleasantry for the old man cackled over it and his cronies joined in with gusto But I said surely you are not quite correct for you start on the assumption that all the poor people or their spirits will have to take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment Do you think that will be really necessary Well what else be they tombstones for Answer me that miss To please their relatives I suppose To please their relatives you suppose This he said with intense scorn How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies He pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab on which the seat was rested close to the edge of the cliff Read the lies on that thruffstean he said The letters were upside down to me from where I sat but Lucy was more opposite to them so she leant over and read Sacred to the memory of George Canon who died in the hope of a glorious resurrection on July 29 1873 falling from the rocks at Kettleness This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son He was the only son of his mother and she was a widow Really Mr Swales I dont see anything very funny in that She spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely Ye dont see aught funny Ha ha But thats because ye dont gawm the sorrowin mother was a hellcat that hated him because he was acrewkda regular lamiter he wasan he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightnt get an insurance she put on his life He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin the crows with Twarnt for crows then for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him Thats the way he fell off the rocks And as to hopes of a glorious resurrection Ive often heard him say masel that he hoped hed go to hell for his mother was so pious that shed be sure to go to heaven an he didnt want to addle where she was Now isnt that stean at any ratehe hammered it with his stick as he spokea pack of lies and wont it make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin up the grees with the tombstean balanced on his hump and asks it to be took as evidence I did not know what to say but Lucy turned the conversation as she said rising up Oh why did you tell us of this It is my favourite seat and I cannot leave it and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide That wont harm ye my pretty an it may make poor Geordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin on his lap That wont hurt ye Why Ive sat here off an on for nigh twenty years past an it hasnt done me no harm Dont ye fash about them as lies under ye or that doesn lie there either Itll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the tombsteans all run away with and the place as bare as a stubblefield Theres the clock an I must gang My service to ye ladies And off he hobbled Lucy and I sat awhile and it was all so beautiful before us that we took hands as we sat and she told me all over again about Arthur and their coming marriage That made me just a little heartsick for I havent heard from Jonathan for a whole month      The same day I came up here alone for I am very sad There was no letter for me I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan The clock has just struck nine I see the lights scattered all over the town sometimes in rows where the streets are and sometimes singly they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley To my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me and there is a clatter of a donkeys hoofs up the paved road below The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time and further along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street Neither of the bands hears the other but up here I hear and see them both I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me I wish he were here Dr Sewards Diary 5 JuneThe case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to understand the man He has certain qualities very largely developed selfishness secrecy and purpose I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter He seems to have some settled scheme of his own but what it is I do not yet know His redeeming quality is a love of animals though indeed he has such curious turns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel His pets are of odd sorts Just now his hobby is catching flies He has at present such a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate To my astonishment he did not break out into a fury as I expected but took the matter in simple seriousness He thought for a moment and then said May I have three days I shall clear them away Of course I said that would do I must watch him      18 JuneHe has turned his mind now to spiders and has got several very big fellows in a box He keeps feeding them with his flies and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room      1 JulyHis spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies and today I told him that he must get rid of them He looked very sad at this so I said that he must clear out some of them at all events He cheerfully acquiesced in this and I gave him the same time as before for reduction He disgusted me much while with him for when a horrid blowfly bloated with some carrion food buzzed into the room he caught it held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb and before I knew what he was going to do put it in his mouth and ate it I scolded him for it but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome that it was life strong life and gave life to him This gave me an idea or the rudiment of one I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders He has evidently some deep problem in his mind for he keeps a little notebook in which he is always jotting down something Whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures generally single numbers added up in batches and then the totals added in batches again as though he were focussing some account as the auditors put it      8 JulyThere is a method in his madness and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing It will be a whole idea soon and then oh unconscious cerebration you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother I kept away from my friend for a few days so that I might notice if there were any change Things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one He has managed to get a sparrow and has already partially tamed it His means of taming is simple for already the spiders have diminished Those that do remain however are well fed for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food      19 JulyWe are progressing My friend has now a whole colony of sparrows and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated When I came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favoura very very great favour and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog I asked him what it was and he said with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing A kitten a nice little sleek playful kitten that I can play with and teach and feedand feedand feed I was not unprepared for this request for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders so I said I would see about it and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten His eagerness betrayed him as he answered Oh yes I would like a cat I only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat No one would refuse me a kitten would they I shook my head and said that at present I feared it would not be possible but that I would see about it His face fell and I could see a warning of danger in it for there was a sudden fierce sidelong look which meant killing The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out then I shall know more      10 p mI have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat that his salvation depended upon it I was firm however and told him that he could not have it whereupon he went without a word and sat down gnawing his fingers in the corner where I had found him I shall see him in the morning early      20 JulyVisited Renfield very early before the attendant went his rounds Found him up and humming a tune He was spreading out his sugar which he had saved in the window and was manifestly beginning his flycatching again and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace I looked around for his birds and not seeing them asked him where they were He replied without turning round that they had all flown away There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood I said nothing but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day      11 a mThe attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers My belief is doctor he said that he has eaten his birds and that he just took and ate them raw      11 p mI gave Renfield a strong opiate tonight enough to make even him sleep and took away his pocketbook to look at it The thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete and the theory proved My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind I shall have to invent a new classification for him and call him a zophagous lifeeating maniac what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way He gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds What would have been his later steps It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment It might be done if there were only a sufficient cause Men sneered at vivisection and yet look at its results today Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspectthe knowledge of the brain Had I even the secret of one such minddid I hold the key to the fancy of even one lunaticI might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which BurdonSandersons physiology or Ferriers brainknowledge would be as nothing If only there were a sufficient cause I must not think too much of this or I may be tempted a good cause might turn the scale with me for may not I too be of an exceptional brain congenitally How well the man reasoned lunatics always do within their own scope I wonder at how many lives he values a man or if at only one He has closed the account most accurately and today begun a new record How many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope and that truly I began a new record So it will be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss Oh Lucy Lucy I cannot be angry with you nor can I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours but I must only wait on hopeless and work Work work If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend therea good unselfish cause to make me workthat would be indeed happiness Mina Murrays Journal 26 JulyI am anxious and it soothes me to express myself here it is like whispering to ones self and listening at the same time And there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan I had not heard from Jonathan for some time and was very concerned but yesterday dear Mr Hawkins who is always so kind sent me a letter from him I had written asking him if he had heard and he said the enclosed had just been received It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula and says that he is just starting for home That is not like Jonathan I do not understand it and it makes me uneasy Then too Lucy although she is so well has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep Her mother has spoken to me about it and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room every night Mrs Westenra has got an idea that sleepwalkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place Poor dear she is naturally anxious about Lucy and she tells me that her husband Lucys father had the same habit that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out if he were not stopped Lucy is to be married in the autumn and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged I sympathise with her for I do the same only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way and shall have to try to make both ends meet Mr Holmwoodhe is the Hon Arthur Holmwood only son of Lord Godalmingis coming up here very shortlyas soon as he can leave town for his father is not very well and I think dear Lucy is counting the moments till he comes She wants to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her she will be all right when he arrives      27 JulyNo news from Jonathan I am getting quite uneasy about him though why I should I do not know but I do wish that he would write if it were only a single line Lucy walks more than ever and each night I am awakened by her moving about the room Fortunately the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold but still the anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me and I am getting nervous and wakeful myself Thank God Lucys health keeps up Mr Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father who has been taken seriously ill Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him but it does not touch her looks she is a trifle stouter and her cheeks are a lovely rosepink She has lost that anmic look which she had I pray it will all last      3 AugustAnother week gone and no news from Jonathan not even to Mr Hawkins from whom I have heard Oh I do hope he is not ill He surely would have written I look at that last letter of his but somehow it does not satisfy me It does not read like him and yet it is his writing There is no mistake of that Lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week but there is an odd concentration about her which I do not understand even in her sleep she seems to be watching me She tries the door and finding it locked goes about the room searching for the key 6 AugustAnother three days and no news This suspense is getting dreadful If I only knew where to write to or where to go to I should feel easier but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last letter I must only pray to God for patience Lucy is more excitable than ever but is otherwise well Last night was very threatening and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm I must try to watch it and learn the weather signs Today is a grey day and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds high over Kettleness Everything is greyexcept the green grass which seems like emerald amongst it grey earthy rock grey clouds tinged with the sunburst at the far edge hang over the grey sea into which the sandpoints stretch like grey fingers The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar muffled in the seamists drifting inland The horizon is lost in a grey mist All is vastness the clouds are piled up like giant rocks and there is a brool over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom Dark figures are on the beach here and there sometimes half shrouded in the mist and seem men like trees walking The fishingboats are racing for home and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour bending to the scuppers Here comes old Mr Swales He is making straight for me and I can see by the way he lifts his hat that he wants to talk I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man When he sat down beside me he said in a very gentle way I want to say something to you miss I could see he was not at ease so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully so he said leaving his hand in mine Im afraid my deary that I must have shocked you by all the wicked things Ive been sayin about the dead and such like for weeks past but I didnt mean them and I want ye to remember that when Im gone We aud folks that be daffled and with one foot abaft the krokhooal dont altogether like to think of it and we dont want to feel scart of it an thats why Ive took to makin light of it so that Id cheer up my own heart a bit But Lord love ye miss I aint afraid of dyin not a bit only I dont want to die if I can help it My time must be nigh at hand now for I be aud and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect and Im so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin his scythe Ye see I cant get out o the habit of caffin about it all at once the chafts will wag as they be used to Some day soon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me But dont ye dooal an greet my dearyfor he saw that I was cryingif he should come this very night Id not refuse to answer his call For life be after all only a waitin for somethin else than what were doin and death be all that we can rightly depend on But Im content for its comin to me my deary and comin quick It may be comin while we be lookin and wonderin Maybe its in that wind out over the sea thats bringin with it loss and wreck and sore distress and sad hearts Look look he cried suddenly Theres something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds and looks and tastes and smells like death Its in the air I feel it comin Lord make me answer cheerful when my call comes He held up his arms devoutly and raised his hat His mouth moved as though he were praying After a few minutes silence he got up shook hands with me and blessed me and said goodbye and hobbled off It all touched me and upset me very much I was glad when the coastguard came along with his spyglass under his arm He stopped to talk with me as he always does but all the time kept looking at a strange ship I cant make her out he said shes a Russian by the look of her but shes knocking about in the queerest way She doesnt know her mind a bit she seems to see the storm coming but cant decide whether to run up north in the open or to put in here Look there again She is steered mighty strangely for she doesnt mind the hand on the wheel changes about with every puff of wind Well hear more of her before this time tomorrow CHAPTER VII CUTTING FROM THE DAILYGRAPH 8 AUGUST Pasted in Mina Murrays Journal From a Correspondent Whitby One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here with results both strange and unique The weather had been somewhat sultry but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known and the great body of holidaymakers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods Robin Hoods Bay Rig Mill Runswick Staithes and the various trips in the neighbourhood of Whitby The steamers Emma and Scarborough made trips up and down the coast and there was an unusual amount of tripping both to and from Whitby The day was unusually fine till the afternoon when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east called attention to a sudden show of marestails high in the sky to the northwest The wind was then blowing from the southwest in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked No 2 light breeze The coastguard on duty at once made report and one old fisherman who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm The approach of sunset was so very beautiful so grand in its masses of splendidlycoloured clouds that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness standing boldly athwart the western sky its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunsetcolourflame purple pink green violet and all the tints of gold with here and there masses not large but of seemingly absolute blackness in all sorts of shapes as well outlined as colossal silhouettes The experience was not lost on the painters and doubtless some of the sketches of the Prelude to the Great Storm will grace the R A and R I walls in May next More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his cobble or his mule as they term the different classes of boats would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed The wind fell away entirely during the evening and at midnight there was a dead calm a sultry heat and that prevailing intensity which on the approach of thunder affects persons of a sensitive nature There were but few lights in sight at sea for even the coasting steamers which usually hug the shore so closely kept well to seaward and but few fishingboats were in sight The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set which was seemingly going westwards The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean Shortly before ten oclock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard and the band on the pier with its lively French air was like a discord in the great harmony of natures silence A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea and high overhead the air began to carry a strange faint hollow booming Then without warning the tempest broke With a rapidity which at the time seemed incredible and even afterwards is impossible to realize the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed The waves rose in growing fury each overtopping its fellow till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster Whitecrested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs others broke over the piers and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour The wind roared like thunder and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time masses of seafog came drifting inlandwhite wet clouds which swept by in ghostly fashion so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of seamist swept by At times the mist cleared and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning which now came thick and fast followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interestthe sea running mountains high threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space here and there a fishingboat with a rag of sail running madly for shelter before the blast now and again the white wings of a stormtossed seabird On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment but had not yet been tried The officers in charge of it got it into working order and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea Once or twice its service was most effective as when a fishingboat with gunwale under water rushed into the harbour able by the guidance of the sheltering light to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening The wind had by this time backed to the east and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered and with the wind blowing from its present quarter it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour It was now nearly the hour of high tide but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible and the schooner with all sails set was rushing with such speed that in the words of one old salt she must fetch up somewhere if it was only in hell Then came another rush of seafog greater than any hithertoa mass of dank mist which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall and left available to men only the organ of hearing for the roar of the tempest and the crash of the thunder and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier where the shock was expected and men waited breathless The wind suddenly shifted to the northeast and the remnant of the seafog melted in the blast and then mirabile dictu between the piers leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed swept the strange schooner before the blast with all sail set and gained the safety of the harbour The searchlight followed her and a shudder ran through all who saw her for lashed to the helm was a corpse with drooping head which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship No other form could be seen on deck at all A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship as if by a miracle had found the harbour unsteered save by the hand of a dead man However all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words The schooner paused not but rushing across the harbour pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff known locally as Tate Hill Pier There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap Every spar rope and stay was strained and some of the tophammer came crashing down But strangest of all the very instant the shore was touched an immense dog sprang up on deck from below as if shot up by the concussion and running forward jumped from the bow on the sand Making straight for the steep cliff where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstonesthruffsteans or throughstones as they call them in the Whitby vernacularactually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away it disappeared in the darkness which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour who at once ran down to the little pier was the first to climb on board The men working the searchlight after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there The coastguard ran aft and when he came beside the wheel bent over to examine it and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion This seemed to pique general curiosity and quite a number of people began to run It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier but your correspondent is a fairly good runner and came well ahead of the crowd When I arrived however I found already assembled on the pier a crowd whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board By the courtesy of the chief boatman I was as your correspondent permitted to climb on deck and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised or even awed for not often can such a sight have been seen The man was simply fastened by his hands tied one over the other to a spoke of the wheel Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel and all kept fast by the binding cords The poor fellow may have been seated at one time but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone Accurate note was made of the state of things and a doctorSurgeon J M Caffyn of 33 East Elliot Placewho came immediately after me declared after making examination that the man must have been dead for quite two days In his pocket was a bottle carefully corked empty save for a little roll of paper which proved to be the addendum to the log The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands fastening the knots with his teeth The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications later on in the Admiralty Court for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict Already however the legal tongues are wagging and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain since the tiller as emblemship if not proof of delegated possession is held in a dead hand It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till deatha steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabiancaand placed in the mortuary to await inquest Already the sudden storm is passing and its fierceness is abating crowds are scattering homeward and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds I shall send in time for your next issue further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm Whitby 9 AugustThe sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself It turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna and is called the Demeter She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand with only a small amount of cargoa number of great wooden boxes filled with mould This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor Mr S F Billington of 7 The Crescent who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him The Russian consul too acting for the charterparty took formal possession of the ship and paid all harbour dues etc Nothing is talked about here today except the strange coincidence the officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations As the matter is to be a nine days wonder they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck and more than a few of the members of the S P C A which is very strong in Whitby have tried to befriend the animal To the general disappointment however it was not to be found it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors where it is still hiding in terror There are some who look with dread on such a possibility lest later on it should in itself become a danger for it is evidently a fierce brute Early this morning a large dog a halfbred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier was found dead in the roadway opposite to its masters yard It had been fighting and manifestly had had a savage opponent for its throat was torn away and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw      LaterBy the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector I have been permitted to look over the logbook of the Demeter which was in order up to within three days but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men The greatest interest however is with regard to the paper found in the bottle which was today produced at the inquest and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across As there is no motive for concealment I am permitted to use them and accordingly send you a rescript simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage Of course my statement must be taken cum grano since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul who kindly translated for me time being short LOG OF THE DEMETER Varna to Whitby Written 18 July things so strange happening that I shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land      On 6 July we finished taking in cargo silver sand and boxes of earth At noon set sail East wind fresh Crew five hands  two mates cook and myself captain      On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus Boarded by Turkish Customs officers Backsheesh All correct Under way at 4 p m      On 12 July through Dardanelles More Customs officers and flagboat of guarding squadron Backsheesh again Work of officers thorough but quick Want us off soon At dark passed into Archipelago      On 13 July passed Cape Matapan Crew dissatisfied about something Seemed scared but would not speak out      On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew Men all steady fellows who sailed with me before Mate could not make out what was wrong they only told him there was something and crossed themselves Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him Expected fierce quarrel but all was quiet      On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew Petrofsky was missing Could not account for it Took larboard watch eight bells last night was relieved by Abramoff but did not go to bunk Men more downcast than ever All said they expected something of the kind but would not say more than there was something aboard Mate getting very impatient with them feared some trouble ahead      On 17 July yesterday one of the men Olgaren came to my cabin and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship He said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deckhouse as there was a rainstorm when he saw a tall thin man who was not like any of the crew come up the companionway and go along the deck forward and disappear He followed cautiously but when he got to bows found no one and the hatchways were all closed He was in a panic of superstitious fear and I am afraid the panic may spread To allay it I shall today search entire ship carefully from stem to stern      Later in the day I got together the whole crew and told them as they evidently thought there was some one in the ship we would search from stem to stern First mate angry said it was folly and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike I let him take the helm while the rest began thorough search all keeping abreast with lanterns we left no corner unsearched As there were only the big wooden boxes there were no odd corners where a man could hide Men much relieved when search over and went back to work cheerfully First mate scowled but said nothing      22 JulyRough weather last three days and all hands busy with sailsno time to be frightened Men seem to have forgotten their dread Mate cheerful again and all on good terms Praised men for work in bad weather Passed Gibralter and out through Straits All well      24 JulyThere seems some doom over this ship Already a hand short and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead and yet last night another man lostdisappeared Like the first he came off his watch and was not seen again Men all in a panic of fear sent a round robin asking to have double watch as they fear to be alone Mate angry Fear there will be some trouble as either he or the men will do some violence      28 JulyFour days in hell knocking about in a sort of maelstrom and the wind a tempest No sleep for any one Men all worn out Hardly know how to set a watch since no one fit to go on Second mate volunteered to steer and watch and let men snatch a few hours sleep Wind abating seas still terrific but feel them less as ship is steadier      29 JulyAnother tragedy Had single watch tonight as crew too tired to double When morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman Raised outcry and all came on deck Thorough search but no one found Are now without second mate and crew in a panic Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause      30 JulyLast night Rejoiced we are nearing England Weather fine all sails set Retired worn out slept soundly awaked by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing Only self and mate and two hands left to work ship      1 AugustTwo days of fog and not a sail sighted Had hoped when in the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere Not having power to work sails have to run before wind Dare not lower as could not raise them again We seem to be drifting to some terrible doom Mate now more demoralised than either of men His stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself Men are beyond fear working stolidly and patiently with minds made up to worst They are Russian he Roumanian      2 August midnightWoke up from few minutes sleep by hearing a cry seemingly outside my port Could see nothing in fog Rushed on deck and ran against mate Tells me heard cry and ran but no sign of man on watch One more gone Lord help us Mate says we must be past Straits of Dover as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland just as he heard the man cry out If so we are now off in the North Sea and only God can guide us in the fog which seems to move with us and God seems to have deserted us      3 AugustAt midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel and when I got to it found no one there The wind was steady and as we ran before it there was no yawing I dared not leave it so shouted for the mate After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels He looked wildeyed and haggard and I greatly fear his reason has given way He came close to me and whispered hoarsely with his mouth to my ear as though fearing the very air might hear It is here I know it now On the watch last night I saw It like a man tall and thin and ghastly pale It was in the bows and looking out I crept behind It and gave It my knife but the knife went through It empty as the air And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space Then he went on But It is here and Ill find It It is in the hold perhaps in one of those boxes Ill unscrew them one by one and see You work the helm And with a warning look and his finger on his lip he went below There was springing up a choppy wind and I could not leave the helm I saw him come out on deck again with a toolchest and a lantern and go down the forward hatchway He is mad stark raving mad and its no use my trying to stop him He cant hurt those big boxes they are invoiced as clay and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do So here I stay and mind the helm and write these notes I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears Then if I cant steer to any harbour with the wind that is I shall cut down sails and lie by and signal for help      It is nearly all over now Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmerfor I heard him knocking away at something in the hold and work is good for himthere came up the hatchway a sudden startled scream which made my blood run cold and up on the deck he came as if shot from a guna raging madman with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear Save me save me he cried and then looked round on the blanket of fog His horror turned to despair and in a steady voice he said You had better come too captain before it is too late He is there I know the secret now The sea will save me from Him and it is all that is left Before I could say a word or move forward to seize him he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea I suppose I know the secret too now It was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one and now he has followed them himself God help me How am I to account for all these horrors when I get to port When I get to port Will that ever be      4 AugustStill fog which the sunrise cannot pierce I know there is sunrise because I am a sailor why else I know not I dared not go below I dared not leave the helm so here all night I stayed and in the dimness of the night I saw ItHim God forgive me but the mate was right to jump overboard It was better to die like a man to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object But I am captain and I must not leave my ship But I shall baffle this fiend or monster for I shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail and along with them I shall tie that which HeItdare not touch and then come good wind or foul I shall save my soul and my honour as a captain I am growing weaker and the night is coming on If He can look me in the face again I may not have time to act If we are wrecked mayhap this bottle may be found and those who find it may understand if not  well then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust God and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty      Of course the verdict was an open one There is no evidence to adduce and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none to say The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero and he is to be given a public funeral Already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave No trace has ever been found of the great dog at which there is much mourning for with public opinion in its present state he would I believe be adopted by the town Tomorrow will see the funeral and so will end this one more mystery of the sea Mina Murrays Journal 8 AugustLucy was very restless all night and I too could not sleep The storm was fearful and as it boomed loudly among the chimneypots it made me shudder When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun Strangely enough Lucy did not wake but she got up twice and dressed herself Fortunately each time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her and got her back to bed It is a very strange thing this sleepwalking for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way her intention if there be any disappears and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night There were very few people about and though the sun was bright and the air clear and fresh the big grimlooking waves that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow forced themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbourlike a bullying man going through a crowd Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night but on land But oh is he on land or sea Where is he and how I am getting fearfully anxious about him If I only knew what to do and could do anything      10 AugustThe funeral of the poor seacaptain today was most touching Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard Lucy came with me and we went early to our old seat whilst the cortge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again We had a lovely view and saw the procession nearly all the way The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything Poor Lucy seemed much upset She was restless and uneasy all the time and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her She is quite odd in one thing she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness or if there be she does not understand it herself There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr Swales was found dead this morning on our seat his neck being broken He had evidently as the doctor said fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder Poor dear old man Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed though I am myself very fond of animals One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog The dog is always with him They are both quiet persons and I never saw the man angry nor heard the dog bark During the service the dog would not come to its master who was on the seat with us but kept a few yards off barking and howling Its master spoke to it gently and then harshly and then angrily but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise It was in a sort of fury with its eyes savage and all its hairs bristling out like a cats tail when puss is on the warpath Finally the man too got angry and jumped down and kicked the dog and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble It did not try to get away but crouched down quivering and cowering and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried though without effect to comfort it Lucy was full of pity too but she did not attempt to touch the dog but looked at it in an agonised sort of way I greatly fear that she is of too supersensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble She will be dreaming of this tonight I am sure The whole agglomeration of thingsthe ship steered into port by a dead man his attitude tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads the touching funeral the dog now furious and now in terrorwill all afford material for her dreams I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically so I shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hoods Bay and back She ought not to have much inclination for sleepwalking then CHAPTER VIII MINA MURRAYS JOURNAL Same day 11 oclock p mOh but I am tired If it were not that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it tonight We had a lovely walk Lucy after a while was in gay spirits owing I think to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse and frightened the wits out of us I believe we forgot everything except of course personal fear and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start We had a capital severe tea at Robin Hoods Bay in a sweet little oldfashioned inn with a bowwindow right over the seaweedcovered rocks of the strand I believe we should have shocked the New Woman with our appetites Men are more tolerant bless them Then we walked home with some or rather many stoppages to rest and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls Lucy was really tired and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could The young curate came in however and Mrs Westenra asked him to stay for supper Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller I know it was a hard fight on my part and I am quite heroic I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates who dont take supper no matter how they may be pressed to and who will know when girls are tired Lucy is asleep and breathing softly She has more colour in her cheeks than usual and looks oh so sweet If Mr Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawingroom I wonder what he would say if he saw her now Some of the New Women writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting But I suppose the New Woman wont condescend in future to accept she will do the proposing herself And a nice job she will make of it too Theres some consolation in that I am so happy tonight because dear Lucy seems better I really believe she has turned the corner and that we are over her troubles with dreaming I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan God bless and keep him      11 August 3 a mDiary again No sleep now so I may as well write I am too agitated to sleep We have had such an adventure such an agonising experience I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary Suddenly I became broad awake and sat up with a horrible sense of fear upon me and of some feeling of emptiness around me The room was dark so I could not see Lucys bed I stole across and felt for her The bed was empty I lit a match and found that she was not in the room The door was shut but not locked as I had left it I feared to wake her mother who has been more than usually ill lately so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention Dressinggown would mean house dress outside Dressinggown and dress were both in their places Thank God I said to myself she cannot be far as she is only in her nightdress I ran downstairs and looked in the sittingroom Not there Then I looked in all the other open rooms of the house with an evergrowing fear chilling my heart Finally I came to the hall door and found it open It was not wide open but the catch of the lock had not caught The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was There was no time to think of what might happen a vague overmastering fear obscured all details I took a big heavy shawl and ran out The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent and there was not a soul in sight I ran along the North Terrace but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff in the hope or fearI dont know whichof seeing Lucy in our favourite seat There was a bright full moon with heavy black driving clouds which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across For a moment or two I could see nothing as the shadow of a cloud obscured St Marys Church and all around it Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a swordcut moved along the church and the churchyard became gradually visible Whatever my expectation was it was not disappointed for there on our favourite seat the silver light of the moon struck a halfreclining figure snowy white The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much for shadow shut down on light almost immediately but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone and bent over it What it was whether man or beast I could not tell I did not wait to catch another glance but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fishmarket to the bridge which was the only way to reach the East Cliff The town seemed as dead for not a soul did I see I rejoiced that it was so for I wanted no witness of poor Lucys condition The time and distance seemed endless and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey I must have gone fast and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead and as though every joint in my body were rusty When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow There was undoubtedly something long and black bending over the halfreclining white figure I called in fright Lucy Lucy and something raised a head and from where I was I could see a white face and red gleaming eyes Lucy did not answer and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard As I entered the church was between me and the seat and for a minute or so I lost sight of her When I came in view again the cloud had passed and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat She was quite alone and there was not a sign of any living thing about When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep Her lips were parted and she was breathingnot softly as usual with her but in long heavy gasps as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath As I came close she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat Whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her as though she felt the cold I flung the warm shawl over her and drew the edges tight round her neck for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air unclad as she was I feared to wake her all at once so in order to have my hands free that I might help her I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safetypin but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it for byandby when her breathing became quieter she put her hand to her throat again and moaned When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her At first she did not respond but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep moaning and sighing occasionally At last as time was passing fast and for many other reasons I wished to get her home at once I shook her more forcibly till finally she opened her eyes and awoke She did not seem surprised to see me as of course she did not realise all at once where she was Lucy always wakes prettily and even at such a time when her body must have been chilled with cold and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night she did not lose her grace She trembled a little and clung to me when I told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word with the obedience of a child As we passed along the gravel hurt my feet and Lucy noticed me wince She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes but I would not However when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard where there was a puddle of water remaining from the storm I daubed my feet with mud using each foot in turn on the other so that as we went home no one in case we should meet any one should notice my bare feet Fortune favoured us and we got home without meeting a soul Once we saw a man who seemed not quite sober passing along a street in front of us but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here steep little closes or wynds as they call them in Scotland My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I should faint I was filled with anxiety about Lucy not only for her health lest she should suffer from the exposure but for her reputation in case the story should get wind When we got in and had washed our feet and had said a prayer of thankfulness together I tucked her into bed Before falling asleep she askedeven imploredme not to say a word to any one even her mother about her sleepwalking adventure I hesitated at first to promise but on thinking of the state of her mothers health and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her and thinking too of how such a story might become distortednay infallibly wouldin case it should leak out I thought it wiser to do so I hope I did right I have locked the door and the key is tied to my wrist so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed Lucy is sleeping soundly the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea      Same day noonAll goes well Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her on the contrary it has benefited her for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safetypin hurt her Indeed it might have been serious for the skin of her throat was pierced I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it for there are two little red points like pinpricks and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood When I apologised and was concerned about it she laughed and petted me and said she did not even feel it Fortunately it cannot leave a scar as it is so tiny      Same day nightWe passed a happy day The air was clear and the sun bright and there was a cool breeze We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods Mrs Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliffpath and joining her at the gate I felt a little sad myself for I could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had Jonathan been with me But there I must only be patient In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie and went to bed early Lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time and fell asleep at once I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before though I do not expect any trouble tonight      12 AugustMy expectations were wrong for twice during the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out She seemed even in her sleep to be a little impatient at finding the door shut and went back to bed under a sort of protest I woke with the dawn and heard the birds chirping outside of the window Lucy woke too and I was glad to see was even better than on the previous morning All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan and then she tried to comfort me Well she succeeded somewhat for though sympathy cant alter facts it can help to make them more bearable      13 AugustAnother quiet day and to bed with the key on my wrist as before Again I awoke in the night and found Lucy sitting up in bed still asleep pointing to the window I got up quietly and pulling aside the blind looked out It was brilliant moonlight and the soft effect of the light over the sea and skymerged together in one great silent mysterywas beautiful beyond words Between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat coming and going in great whirling circles Once or twice it came quite close but was I suppose frightened at seeing me and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully She did not stir again all night      14 AugustOn the East Cliff reading and writing all day Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner This afternoon she made a funny remark We were coming home for dinner and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view as we generally do The setting sun low down in the sky was just dropping behind Kettleness the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow We were silent for a while and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself His red eyes again They are just the same It was such an odd expression coming apropos of nothing that it quite startled me I slewed round a little so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her and saw that she was in a halfdreamy state with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out so I said nothing but followed her eyes She appeared to be looking over at our own seat whereon was a dark figure seated alone I was a little startled myself for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames but a second look dispelled the illusion The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St Marys Church behind our seat and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved I called Lucys attention to the peculiar effect and she became herself with a start but she looked sad all the same it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there We never refer to it so I said nothing and we went home to dinner Lucy had a headache and went early to bed I saw her asleep and went out for a little stroll myself I walked along the cliffs to the westward and was full of sweet sadness for I was thinking of Jonathan When coming homeit was then bright moonlight so bright that though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow everything could be well seenI threw a glance up at our window and saw Lucys head leaning out I thought that perhaps she was looking out for me so I opened my handkerchief and waved it She did not notice or make any movement whatever Just then the moonlight crept round an angle of the building and the light fell on the window There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the windowsill and her eyes shut She was fast asleep and by her seated on the windowsill was something that looked like a goodsized bird I was afraid she might get a chill so I ran upstairs but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed fast asleep and breathing heavily she was holding her hand to her throat as though to protect it from cold I did not wake her but tucked her up warmly I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened She looks so sweet as she sleeps but she is paler than is her wont and there is a drawn haggard look under her eyes which I do not like I fear she is fretting about something I wish I could find out what it is      15 AugustRose later than usual Lucy was languid and tired and slept on after we had been called We had a happy surprise at breakfast Arthurs father is better and wants the marriage to come off soon Lucy is full of quiet joy and her mother is glad and sorry at once Later on in the day she told me the cause She is grieved to lose Lucy as her very own but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her Poor dear sweet lady She confided to me that she has got her deathwarrant She has not told Lucy and made me promise secrecy her doctor told her that within a few months at most she must die for her heart is weakening At any time even now a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her Ah we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucys sleepwalking      17 AugustNo diary for two whole days I have not had the heart to write Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness No news from Jonathan and Lucy seems to be growing weaker whilst her mothers hours are numbering to a close I do not understand Lucys fading away as she is doing She eats well and sleeps well and enjoys the fresh air but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading and she gets weaker and more languid day by day at night I hear her gasping as if for air I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night but she gets up and walks about the room and sits at the open window Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up and when I tried to wake her I could not she was in a faint When I managed to restore her she was as weak as water and cried silently between long painful struggles for breath When I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safetypin I looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed They are still open and if anything larger than before and the edges of them are faintly white They are like little white dots with red centres Unless they heal within a day or two I shall insist on the

Pro CARTER PATERSON  CO Mina Murrays Journal 18 AugustI am happy today and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard Lucy is ever so much better Last night she slept well all night and did not disturb me once The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks though she is still sadly pale and wanlooking If she were in any way anmic I could understand it but she is not She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her and she has just reminded me as if I needed any reminding of that night and that it was here on this very seat I found her asleep As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said My poor little feet didnt make much noise then I daresay poor old Mr Swales would have told me that it was because I didnt want to wake up Geordie As she was in such a communicative humour I asked her if she had dreamed at all that night Before she answered that sweet puckered look came into her forehead which ArthurI call him Arthur from her habitsays he loves and indeed I dont wonder that he does Then she went on in a halfdreaming kind of way as if trying to recall it to herself I didnt quite dream but it all seemed to be real I only wanted to be here in this spotI dont know why for I was afraid of somethingI dont know what I remember though I suppose I was asleep passing through the streets and over the bridge A fish leaped as I went by and I leaned over to look at it and I heard a lot of dogs howlingthe whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at onceas I went up the steps Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes just as we saw in the sunset and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once and then I seemed sinking into deep green water and there was a singing in my ears as I have heard there is to drowning men and then everything seemed passing away from me my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me and then there was a sort of agonising feeling as if I were in an earthquake and I came back and found you shaking my body I saw you do it before I felt you Then she began to laugh It seemed a little uncanny to me and I listened to her breathlessly I did not quite like it and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject so we drifted on to other subjects and Lucy was like her old self again When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up and her pale cheeks were really more rosy Her mother rejoiced when she saw her and we all spent a very happy evening together      19 AugustJoy joy joy although not all joy At last news of Jonathan The dear fellow has been ill that is why he did not write I am not afraid to think it or say it now that I know Mr Hawkins sent me on the letter and wrote himself oh so kindly I am to leave in the morning and go over to Jonathan and to help to nurse him if necessary and to bring him home Mr Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there I have cried over the good Sisters letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom where it lies It is of Jonathan and must be next my heart for he is in my heart My journey is all mapped out and my luggage ready I am only taking one change of dress Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for it for it may be that  I must write no more I must keep it to say to Jonathan my husband The letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet Letter Sister Agatha Hospital of St Joseph and Ste Mary BudaPesth to Miss Wilhelmina Murray 12 August Dear Madam I write by desire of Mr Jonathan Harker who is himself not strong enough to write though progressing well thanks to God and St Joseph and Ste Mary He has been under our care for nearly six weeks suffering from a violent brain fever He wishes me to convey his love and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr Peter Hawkins Exeter to say with his dutiful respects that he is sorry for his delay and that all of his work is completed He will require some few weeks rest in our sanatorium in the hills but will then return He wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him and that he would like to pay for his staying here so that others who need shall not be wanting for help Believe me Yours with sympathy and all blessings SISTER AGATHA P SMy patient being asleep I open this to let you know something more He has told me all about you and that you are shortly to be his wife All blessings to you both He has had some fearful shockso says our doctorand in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful of wolves and poison and blood of ghosts and demons and I fear to say of what Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come the traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away We should have written long ago but we knew nothing of his friends and there was on him nothing that any one could understand He came in the train from Klausenburg and the guard was told by the stationmaster there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home Seeing from his violent demeanour that he was English they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way thither that the train reached Be assured that he is well cared for He has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness He is truly getting on well and I have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself But be careful of him for safetys sake

and sniff about as a dog does when setting The attendant was struck by his manner and knowing my interest in him encouraged him to talk He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile but tonight the man tells me he was quite haughty Would not condescend to talk with him at all All he would say was I dont want to talk to you you dont count now the Master is at hand The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him If so we must look out for squalls for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous The combination is a dreadful one At nine oclock I visited him myself His attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant in his sublime selffeeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing It looks like religious mania and he will soon think that he himself is God These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being How these madmen give themselves away The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall but the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow Oh if men only knew For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree I did not pretend to be watching him but I kept strict observation all the same All at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well He became quite quiet and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly and looked into space with lacklustre eyes I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed and tried to lead him to talk of his pets a theme which had never failed to excite his attention At first he made no reply but at length said testily Bother them all I dont care a pin about them What I said You dont mean to tell me you dont care about spiders Spiders at present are his hobby and the notebook is filling up with columns of small figures To this he answered enigmatically The bridemaidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride but when the bride draweth nigh then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled He would not explain himself but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time I remained with him I am weary tonight and low in spirits I cannot but think of Lucy and how different things might have been If I dont sleep at once chloral the modern MorpheusC2HCl3O H2O I must be careful not to let it grow into a habit No I shall take none tonight I have thought of Lucy and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two If need be tonight shall be sleepless      LaterGlad I made the resolution gladder that I kept to it I had lain tossing about and had heard the clock strike only twice when the nightwatchman came to me sent up from the ward to say that Renfield had escaped I threw on my clothes and ran down at once my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers The attendant was waiting for me He said he had seen him not ten minutes before seemingly asleep in his bed when he had looked through the observationtrap in the door His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window and had at once sent up for me He was only in his nightgear and cannot be far off The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door He is a bulky man and couldnt get through the window I am thin so with his aid I got out but feet foremost and as we were only a few feet above ground landed unhurt The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left and had taken a straight line so I ran as quickly as I could As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house I ran back at once told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax in case our friend might be dangerous I got a ladder myself and crossing the wall dropped down on the other side I could see Renfields figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house so I ran after him On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel He was talking apparently to some one but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying lest I might frighten him and he should run off Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic when the fit of escaping is upon him After a few minutes however I could see that he did not take note of anything around him and so ventured to draw nearer to himthe more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in I heard him say I am here to do Your bidding Master I am Your slave and You will reward me for I shall be faithful I have worshipped You long and afar off Now that You are near I await Your commands and You will not pass me by will You dear Master in Your distribution of good things He is a selfish old beggar anyhow He thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a Real Presence His manias make a startling combination When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger He is immensely strong for he was more like a wild beast than a man I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before and I hope I shall not again It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time With strength and determination like his he might have done wild work before he was caged He is safe now at any rate Jack Sheppard himself couldnt get free from the straitwaistcoat that keeps him restrained and hes chained to the wall in the padded room His cries are at times awful but the silences that follow are more deadly still for he means murder in every turn and movement Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time I shall be patient Master It is comingcomingcoming So I took the hint and came too I was too excited to sleep but this diary has quieted me and I feel I shall get some sleep tonight CHAPTER IX Letter Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra BudaPesth 24 August My dearest Lucy I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at Whitby Well my dear I got to Hull all right and caught the boat to Hamburg and then the train on here I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey except that I knew I was coming to Jonathan and that as I should have to do some nursing I had better get all the sleep I could I found my dear one oh so thin and pale and weaklooking All the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished He is only a wreck of himself and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past At least he wants me to believe so and I shall never ask He has had some terrible shock and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it Sister Agatha who is a good creature and a born nurse tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head I wanted her to tell me what they were but she would only cross herself and say she would never tell that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them she should respect her trust She is a sweet good soul and the next day when she saw I was troubled she opened up the subject again and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about added I can tell you this much my dear that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself and you as his wife to be have no cause to be concerned He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you His fear was of great and terrible things which no mortal can treat of I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl The idea of my being jealous about Jonathan And yet my dear let me whisper I felt a thrill of joy through me when I knew that no other woman was a cause of trouble I am now sitting by his bedside where I can see his face while he sleeps He is waking When he woke he asked me for his coat as he wanted to get something from the pocket I asked Sister Agatha and she brought all his things I saw that amongst them was his notebook and was going to ask him to let me look at itfor I knew then that I might find some clue to his troublebut I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes for he sent me over to the window saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment Then he called me back and when I came he had his hand over the notebook and he said to me very solemnly WilhelminaI knew then that he was in deadly earnest for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry himyou know dear my ideas of the trust between husband and wife there should be no secret no concealment I have had a great shock and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round and I do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman You know I have had brain fever and that is to be mad The secret is here and I do not want to know it I want to take up my life here with our marriage For my dear we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete Are you willing Wilhelmina to share my ignorance Here is the book Take it and keep it read it if you will but never let me know unless indeed some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awake sane or mad recorded here He fell back exhausted and I put the book under his pillow and kissed him I have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon and am waiting her reply      She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission church has been sent for We are to be married in an hour or as soon after as Jonathan awakes      Lucy the time has come and gone I feel very solemn but very very happy Jonathan woke a little after the hour and all was ready and he sat up in bed propped up with pillows He answered his I will firmly and strongly I could hardly speak my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me The dear sisters were so kind Please God I shall never never forget them nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken upon me I must tell you of my wedding present When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husbandoh Lucy it is the first time I have written the words my husbandleft me alone with my husband I took the book from under his pillow and wrapped it up in white paper and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck and sealed it over the knot with sealingwax and for my seal I used my wedding ring Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband and told him that I would keep it so and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty Then he took my hand in his and oh Lucy it was the first time he took his wifes hand and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world and that he would go through all the past again to win it if need be The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past but he cannot think of time yet and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month but the year Well my dear what could I say I could only tell him that I was the happiest woman in all the wide world and that I had nothing to give him except myself my life and my trust and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life And my dear when he kissed me and drew me to him with his poor weak hands it was like a very solemn pledge between us Lucy dear do you know why I tell you all this It is not only because it is all sweet to me but because you have been and are very dear to me It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life I want you to see now and with the eyes of a very happy wife whither duty has led me so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am My dear please Almighty God your life may be all it promises a long day of sunshine with no harsh wind no forgetting duty no distrust I must not wish you no pain for that can never be but I do hope you will be always as happy as I am now Goodbye my dear I shall post this at once and perhaps write you very soon again I must stop for Jonathan is wakingI must attend to my husband Your everloving MINA HARKER Letter Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker Whitby 30 August My dearest Mina Oceans of love and millions of kisses and may you soon be in your own home with your husband I wish you could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here The strong air would soon restore Jonathan it has quite restored me I have an appetite like a cormorant am full of life and sleep well You will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a week that is when I once got into it at night Arthur says I am getting fat By the way I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here We have such walks and drives and rides and rowing and tennis and fishing together and I love him more than ever He tells me that he loves me more but I doubt that for at first he told me that he couldnt love me more than he did then But this is nonsense There he is calling to me So no more just at present from your loving LUCY P SMother sends her love She seems better poor dear P P SWe are to be married on 28 September Dr Sewards Diary 20 AugustThe case of Renfield grows even more interesting He has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent Then one night just as the moon rose he grew quiet and kept murmuring to himself Now I can wait now I can wait The attendant came to tell me so I ran down at once to have a look at him He was still in the straitwaistcoat and in the padded room but the suffused look had gone from his face and his eyes had something of their old pleadingI might almost say cringingsoftness I was satisfied with his present condition and directed him to be relieved The attendants hesitated but finally carried out my wishes without protest It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust for coming close to me he said in a whisper all the while looking furtively at them They think I could hurt you Fancy me hurting you The fools It was soothing somehow to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others but all the same I do not follow his thought Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him so that we are as it were to stand together or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my wellbeing is needful to him I must find out later on Tonight he will not speak Even the offer of a kitten or even a fullgrown cat will not tempt him He will only say I dont take any stock in cats I have more to think of now and I can wait I can wait After a while I left him The attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn and that then he began to get uneasy and at length violent until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma       Three nights has the same thing happenedviolent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise I wish I could get some clue to the cause It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went Happy thought We shall tonight play sane wits against mad ones He escaped before without our help tonight he shall escape with it We shall give him a chance and have the men ready to follow in case they are required      23 AugustThe unexpected always happens How well Disraeli knew life Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly so all our subtle arrangements were for nought At any rate we have proved one thing that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room when once he is quiet until an hour before sunrise The poor souls body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it Hark The unexpected again I am called the patient has once more escaped      LaterAnother night adventure Renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage I sent word for the attendants to follow Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house and we found him in the same place pressed against the old chapel door When he saw me he became furious and had not the attendants seized him in time he would have tried to kill me As we were holding him a strange thing happened He suddenly redoubled his efforts and then as suddenly grew calm I looked round instinctively but could see nothing Then I caught the patients eye and followed it but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west Bats usually wheel and flit about but this one seemed to go straight on as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own The patient grew calmer every instant and presently said You neednt tie me I shall go quietly Without trouble we came back to the house I feel there is something ominous in his calm and shall not forget this night Lucy Westenras Diary Hillingham 24 AugustI must imitate Mina and keep writing things down Then we can have long talks when we do meet I wonder when it will be I wish she were with me again for I feel so unhappy Last night I seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby Perhaps it is the change of air or getting home again It is all dark and horrid to me for I can remember nothing but I am full of vague fear and I feel so weak and worn out When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me and I hadnt the spirit to try to be cheerful I wonder if I could sleep in mothers room tonight I shall make an excuse and try      25 AugustAnother bad night Mother did not seem to take to my proposal She seems not too well herself and doubtless she fears to worry me I tried to keep awake and succeeded for a while but when the clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze so I must have been falling asleep There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window but I did not mind it and as I remember no more I suppose I must then have fallen asleep More bad dreams I wish I could remember them This morning I am horribly weak My face is ghastly pale and my throat pains me It must be something wrong with my lungs for I dont seem ever to get air enough I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes or else I know he will be miserable to see me so Letter Arthur Holmwood to Dr Seward Albemarle Hotel 31 August My dear Jack I want you to do me a favour Lucy is ill that is she has no special disease but she looks awful and is getting worse every day I have asked her if there is any cause I do not dare to ask her mother for to disturb the poor ladys mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal Mrs Westenra has confided to me that her doom is spokendisease of the heartthough poor Lucy does not know it yet I am sure that there is something preying on my dear girls mind I am almost distracted when I think of her to look at her gives me a pang I told her I should ask you to see her and though she demurred at firstI know why old fellowshe finally consented It will be a painful task for you I know old friend but it is for her sake and I must not hesitate to ask or you to act You are to come to lunch at Hillingham tomorrow two oclock so as not to arouse any suspicion in Mrs Westenra and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you I shall come in for tea and we can go away together I am filled with anxiety and want to consult with you alone as soon as I can after you have seen her Do not fail ARTHUR Telegram Arthur Holmwood to Seward 1 September Am summoned to see my father who is worse Am writing Write me fully by tonights post to Ring Wire me if necessary Letter from Dr Seward to Arthur Holmwood 2 September My dear old fellow With regard to Miss Westenras health I hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady that I know of At the same time I am not by any means satisfied with her appearance she is woefully different from what she was when I saw her last Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full opportunity of examination such as I should wish our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over I had better tell you exactly what happened leaving you to draw in a measure your own conclusions I shall then say what I have done and propose doing I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits Her mother was present and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious I have no doubt she guesses if she does not know what need of caution there is We lunched alone and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful we got as some kind of reward for our labours some real cheerfulness amongst us Then Mrs Westenra went to lie down and Lucy was left with me We went into her boudoir and till we got there her gaiety remained for the servants were coming and going As soon as the door was closed however the mask fell from her face and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh and hid her eyes with her hand When I saw that her high spirits had failed I at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis She said to me very sweetly I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself I reminded her that a doctors confidence was sacred but that you were grievously anxious about her She caught on to my meaning at once and settled that matter in a word Tell Arthur everything you choose I do not care for myself but all for him So I am quite free I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless but I could not see the usual anmic signs and by a chance I was actually able to test the quality of her blood for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass It was a slight matter in itself but it gave me an evident chance and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them The qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition and shows I should infer in itself a vigorous state of health In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety but as there must be a cause somewhere I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times and of heavy lethargic sleep with dreams that frighten her but regarding which she can remember nothing She says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep and that when in Whitby the habit came back and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff where Miss Murray found her but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned I am in doubt and so have done the best thing I know of I have written to my old friend and master Professor Van Helsing of Amsterdam who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world I have asked him to come over and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge I have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to Miss Westenra This my dear fellow is in obedience to your wishes for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for her Van Helsing would I know do anything for me for a personal reason so no matter on what ground he comes we must accept his wishes He is a seemingly arbitrary man but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else He is a philosopher and a metaphysician and one of the most advanced scientists of his day and he has I believe an absolutely open mind This with an iron nerve a temper of the icebrook an indomitable resolution selfcommand and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings and the kindliest and truest heart that beatsthese form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankindwork both in theory and practice for his views are as wide as his allembracing sympathy I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him I have asked him to come at once I shall see Miss Westenra tomorrow again She is to meet me at the Stores so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call Yours always JOHN SEWARD Letter Abraham Van Helsing M D D Ph D Lit etc etc to Dr Seward 2 September My good Friend When I have received your letter I am already coming to you By good fortune I can leave just at once without wrong to any of those who have trusted me Were fortune other then it were bad for those who have trusted for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend too nervous let slip you did more for him when he wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do But it is pleasure added to do for him your friend it is to you that I come Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel so that I may be near to hand and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on tomorrow for it is likely that I may have to return here that night But if need be I shall come again in three days and stay longer if it must Till then goodbye my friend John VAN HELSING Letter Dr Seward to Hon Arthur Holmwood 3 September My dear Art Van Helsing has come and gone He came on with me to Hillingham and found that by Lucys discretion her mother was lunching out so that we were alone with her Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the patient He is to report to me and I shall advise you for of course I was not present all the time He is I fear much concerned but says he must think When I told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter he said You must tell him all you think Tell him what I think if you can guess it if you will Nay I am not jesting This is no jest but life and death perhaps more I asked what he meant by that for he was very serious This was when we had come back to town and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to Amsterdam He would not give me any further clue You must not be angry with me Art because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good He will speak plainly enough when the time comes be sure So I told him I would simply write an account of our visit just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for The Daily Telegraph He seemed not to notice but remarked that the smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here I am to get his report tomorrow if he can possibly make it In any case I am to have a letter Well as to the visit Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first saw her and certainly looked better She had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you and her breathing was normal She was very sweet to the professor as she always is and tried to make him feel at ease though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it I believe Van Helsing saw it too for I saw the quick look under his bushy brows that I knew of old Then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucys pretense of animation merge into reality Then without any seeming change he brought the conversation gently round to his visit and suavely said My dear young miss I have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved That is much my dear ever were there that which I do not see They told me you were down in the spirit and that you were of a ghastly pale To them I say Pouf And he snapped his fingers at me and went on But you and I shall show them how wrong they are How can heand he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class on or rather after a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me ofknow anything of a young ladies He has his madmans to play with and to bring them back to happiness and to those that love them It is much to do and oh but there are rewards in that we can bestow such happiness But the young ladies He has no wife nor daughter and the young do not tell themselves to the young but to the old like me who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them So my dear we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves I took the hint and strolled about and presently the professor came to the window and called me in He looked grave but said I have made careful examination but there is no functional cause With you I agree that there has been much blood lost it has been but is not But the conditions of her are in no way anmic I have asked her to send me her maid that I may ask just one or two question that so I may not chance to miss nothing I know well what she will say And yet there is cause there is always cause for everything I must go back home and think You must send to me the telegram every day and if there be cause I shall come again The diseasefor not to be all well is a diseaseinterest me and the sweet young dear she interest me too She charm me and for her if not for you or disease I come As I tell you he would not say a word more even when we were alone And so now Art you know all I know I shall keep stern watch I trust your poor father is rallying It must be a terrible thing to you my dear old fellow to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you I know your idea of duty to your father and you are right to stick to it but if need be I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy so do not be overanxious unless you hear from me Dr Sewards Diary 4 SeptemberZophagous patient still keeps up our interest in him He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless The attendant knew the symptoms and at once summoned aid Fortunately the men came at a run and were just in time for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him In about five minutes however he began to get more and more quiet and finally sank into a sort of melancholy in which state he has remained up to now The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling I found my hands full when I got in attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him Indeed I can quite understand the effect for the sounds disturbed even me though I was some distance away It is now after the dinnerhour of the asylum and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding with a dull sullen woebegone look in his face which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly I cannot quite understand it      LaterAnother change in my patient At five oclock I looked in on him and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be He was catching flies and eating them and was keeping note of his capture by making nailmarks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding When he saw me he came over and apologised for his bad conduct and asked me in a very humble cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his notebook again I thought it well to humour him so he is back in his room with the window open He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the windowsill and is reaping quite a harvest of flies He is not now eating them but putting them into a box as of old and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider I tried to get him to talk about the past few days for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me but he would not rise For a moment or two he looked very sad and said in a sort of faraway voice as though saying it rather to himself than to me All over all over He has deserted me No hope for me now unless I do it for myself Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way he said Doctor wont you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar I think it would be good for me And the flies I said Yes The flies like it too and I like the flies therefore I like it And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue I procured him a double supply and left him as happy a man as I suppose any in the world I wish I could fathom his mind      MidnightAnother change in him I had been to see Miss Westenra whom I found much better and had just returned and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset when once more I heard him yelling As his room is on this side of the house I could hear it better than in the morning It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building with its wealth of breathing misery and my own desolate heart to endure it all I reached him just as the sun was going down and from his window saw the red disc sink As it sank he became less and less frenzied and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him an inert mass on the floor It is wonderful however what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him I signalled to the attendants not to hold him for I was anxious to see what he would do He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar then he took his flybox and emptied it outside and threw away the box then he shut the window and crossing over sat down on his bed All this surprised me so I asked him Are you not going to keep flies any more No said he I am sick of all that rubbish He certainly is a wonderfully interesting study I wish I could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion Stop there may be a clue after all if we can find why today his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain naturesas at times the moon does others We shall see Telegram Seward London to Van Helsing Amsterdam 4 SeptemberPatient still better today Telegram Seward London to Van Helsing Amsterdam 5 SeptemberPatient greatly improved Good appetite sleeps naturally good spirits colour coming back Telegram Seward London to Van Helsing Amsterdam 6 SeptemberTerrible change for the worse Come at once do not lose an hour I hold over telegram to Holmwood till have seen you CHAPTER X Letter Dr Seward to Hon Arthur Holmwood 6 September My dear Art My news today is not so good Lucy this morning had gone back a bit There is however one good thing which has arisen from it Mrs Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy and has consulted me professionally about her I took advantage of the opportunity and told her that my old master Van Helsing the great specialist was coming to stay with me and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with myself so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly for a shock to her would mean sudden death and this in Lucys weak condition might be disastrous to her We are hedged in with difficulties all of us my poor old fellow but please God we shall come through them all right If any need I shall write so that if you do not hear from me take it for granted that I am simply waiting for news In haste Yours ever JOHN SEWARD Dr Sewards Diary 7 SeptemberThe first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at Liverpool Street was Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her No I said I waited till I had seen you as I said in my telegram I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming as Miss Westenra was not so well and that I should let him know if need be Right my friend he said quite right Better he not know as yet perhaps he shall never know I pray so but if it be needed then he shall know all And my good friend John let me caution you You deal with the madmen All men are mad in some way or the other and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen so deal with Gods madmen toothe rest of the world You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it you tell them not what you think So you shall keep knowledge in its place where it may restwhere it may gather its kind around it and breed You and I shall keep as yet what we know here and here He touched me on the heart and on the forehead and then touched himself the same way I have for myself thoughts at the present Later I shall unfold to you Why not now I asked It may do some good we may arrive at some decision He stopped and looked at me and said My friend John when the corn is grown even before it has ripenedwhile the milk of its motherearth is in him and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands and blow away the green chaff and say to you Look hes good corn he will make good crop when the time comes I did not see the application and told him so For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully as he used long ago to do at lectures and said The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows but not till then But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow that is for the children who play at husbandry and not for those who take it as of the work of their life See you now friend John I have sown my corn and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout if he sprout at all theres some promise and I wait till the ear begins to swell He broke off for he evidently saw that I understood Then he went on and very gravely You were always a careful student and your casebook was ever more full than the rest You were only student then now you are master and I trust that good habit have not fail Remember my friend that knowledge is stronger than memory and we should not trust the weaker Even if you have not kept the good practise let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may bemind I say may beof such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam as your peoples say Take then good note of it Nothing is too small I counsel you put down in record even your doubts and surmises Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess We learn from failure not from success When I described Lucys symptomsthe same as before but infinitely more markedhe looked very grave but said nothing He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade as he once called in one of his lectures the equipment of a professor of the healing craft When we were shown in Mrs Westenra met us She was alarmed but not nearly so much as I expected to find her Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors Here in a case where any shock may prove fatal matters are so ordered that from some cause or other the things not personaleven the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attacheddo not seem to reach her It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact If this be an ordered selfishness then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required She assented readily so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucys room If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday I was horrified when I saw her today She was ghastly chalkily pale the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums and the bones of her face stood out prominently her breathing was painful to see or hear Van Helsings face grew set as marble and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose Lucy lay motionless and did not seem to have strength to speak so for a while we were all silent Then Van Helsing beckoned to me and we went gently out of the room The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door which was open Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door My God he said this is dreadful There is no time to be lost She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the hearts action as it should be There must be transfusion of blood at once Is it you or me I am younger and stronger Professor It must be me Then get ready at once I will bring up my bag I am prepared I went downstairs with him and as we were going there was a knock at the halldoor When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door and Arthur was stepping quickly in He rushed up to me saying in an eager whisper Jack I was so anxious I read between the lines of your letter and have been in an agony The dad was better so I ran down here to see for myself Is not that gentleman Dr Van Helsing I am so thankful to you sir for coming When first the Professors eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time but now as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him his eyes gleamed Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand Sir you have come in time You are the lover of our dear miss She is bad very very bad Nay my child do not go like that For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting You are to help her You can do more than any that live and your courage is your best help What can I do asked Arthur hoarsely Tell me and I shall do it My life is hers and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her The Professor has a strongly humorous side and I could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer My young sir I do not ask so much as thatnot the last What shall I do There was fire in his eyes and his open nostril quivered with intent Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder Come he said You are a man and it is a man we want You are better than me better than my friend John Arthur looked bewildered and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way Young miss is bad very bad She wants blood and blood she must have or die My friend John and I have consulted and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of bloodto transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him John was to give his blood as he is the more young and strong than mehere Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silencebut now you are here you are more good than us old or young who toil much in the world of thought Our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours Arthur turned to him and said If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would understand He stopped with a sort of choke in his voice Good boy said Van Helsing In the notsofaroff you will be happy that you have done all for her you love Come now and be silent You shall kiss her once before it is done but then you must go and you must leave at my sign Say no word to Madame you know how it is with her There must be no shock any knowledge of this would be one Come We all went up to Lucys room Arthur by direction remained outside Lucy turned her head and looked at us but said nothing She was not asleep but she was simply too weak to make the effort Her eyes spoke to us that was all Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight Then he mixed a narcotic and coming over to the bed said cheerily Now little miss here is your medicine Drink it off like a good child See I lift you so that to swallow is easy Yes She had made the effort with success It astonished me how long the drug took to act This in fact marked the extent of her weakness The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids At last however the narcotic began to manifest its potency and she fell into a deep sleep When the Professor was satisfied he called Arthur into the room and bade him strip off his coat Then he added You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring over the table Friend John help to me So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her Van Helsing turning to me said He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it Then with swiftness but with absolute method Van Helsing performed the operation As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucys cheeks and through Arthurs growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine After a bit I began to grow anxious for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur strong man as he was It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucys system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her But the Professors face was set and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur I could hear my own heart beat Presently he said in a soft voice Do not stir an instant It is enough You attend him I will look to her When all was over I could see how much Arthur was weakened I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away when Van Helsing spoke without turning roundthe man seems to have eyes in the back of his head The brave lover I think deserve another kiss which he shall have presently And as he had now finished his operation he adjusted the pillow to the patients head As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her was dragged a little up and showed a red mark on her throat Arthur did not notice it but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsings ways of betraying emotion He said nothing at the moment but turned to me saying Now take down our brave young lover give him of the port wine and let him lie down a while He must then go home and rest sleep much and eat much that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love He must not stay here Hold a moment I may take it sir that you are anxious of result Then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful You have saved her life this time and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is I shall tell her all when she is well she shall love you none the less for what you have done Goodbye When Arthur had gone I went back to the room Lucy was sleeping gently but her breathing was stronger I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved By the bedside sat Van Helsing looking at her intently The velvet band again covered the red mark I asked the Professor in a whisper What do you make of that mark on her throat What do you make of it I have not examined it yet I answered and then and there proceeded to loose the band Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures not large but not wholesomelooking There was no sign of disease but the edges were white and wornlooking as if by some trituration It at once occurred to me that this wound or whatever it was might be the means of that manifest loss of blood but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed for such a thing could not be The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion Well said Van Helsing Well said I I can make nothing of it The Professor stood up I must go back to Amsterdam tonight he said There are books and things there which I want You must remain here all the night and you must not let your sight pass from her Shall I have a nurse I asked We are the best nurses you and I You keep watch all night see that she is well fed and that nothing disturbs her You must not sleep all the night Later on we can sleep you and I I shall be back as soon as possible And then we may begin May begin I said What on earth do you mean We shall see he answered as he hurried out He came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up Remember she is your charge If you leave her and harm befall you shall not sleep easy hereafter Dr Sewards Diarycontinued 8 SeptemberI sat up all night with Lucy The opiate worked itself off towards dusk and she waked naturally she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation Her spirits even were good and she was full of a happy vivacity but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone When I told Mrs Westenra that Dr Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she almost poohpoohed the idea pointing out her daughters renewed strength and excellent spirits I was firm however and made preparations for my long vigil When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in having in the meantime had supper and took a seat by the bedside She did not in any way make objection but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her eye After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off This was repeated several times with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on It was apparent that she did not want to sleep so I tackled the subject at once You do not want to go to sleep No I am afraid Afraid to go to sleep Why so It is the boon we all crave for Ah not if you were like meif sleep was to you a presage of horror A presage of horror What on earth do you mean I dont know oh I dont know And that is what is so terrible All this weakness comes to me in sleep until I dread the very thought But my dear girl you may sleep tonight I am here watching you and I can promise that nothing will happen Ah I can trust you I seized the opportunity and said I promise you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once You will Oh will you really How good you are to me Then I will sleep And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief and sank back asleep All night long I watched by her She never stirred but slept on and on in a deep tranquil lifegiving healthgiving sleep Her lips were slightly parted and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum There was a smile on her face and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind In the early morning her maid came and I left her in her care and took myself back home for I was anxious about many things I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur telling them of the excellent result of the operation My own work with its manifold arrears took me all day to clear off it was dark when I was able to inquire about my zophagous patient The report was good he had been quite quiet for the past day and night A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner suggesting that I should be at Hillingham tonight as it might be well to be at hand and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning      9 SeptemberI was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said No sitting up tonight for you You are worn out I am quite well again indeed I am and if there is to be any sitting up it is I who will sit up with you I would not argue the point but went and had my supper Lucy came with me and enlivened by her charming presence I made an excellent meal and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port Then Lucy took me upstairs and showed me a room next her own where a cozy fire was burning Now she said you must stay here I shall leave this door open and my door too You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon If I want anything I shall call out and you can come to me at once I could not but acquiesce for I was dogtired and could not have sat up had I tried So on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything I lay on the sofa and forgot all about everything Lucy Westenras Diary 9 SeptemberI feel so happy tonight I have been so miserably weak that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky Somehow Arthur feels very very close to me I seem to feel his presence warm about me I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves whilst health and strength give Love rein and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills I know where my thoughts are If Arthur only knew My dear my dear your ears must tingle as you sleep as mine do waking Oh the blissful rest of last night How I slept with that dear good Dr Seward watching me And tonight I shall not fear to sleep since he is close at hand and within call Thank everybody for being so good to me Thank God Goodnight Arthur Dr Sewards Diary 10 SeptemberI was conscious of the Professors hand on my head and started awake all in a second That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum at any rate And how is our patient Well when I left her or rather when she left me I answered Come let us see he said And together we went into the room The blind was down and I went over to raise it gently whilst Van Helsing stepped with his soft catlike tread over to the bed As I raised the blind and the morning sunlight flooded the room I heard the Professors low hiss of inspiration and knowing its rarity a deadly fear shot through my heart As I passed over he moved back and his exclamation of horror Gott in Himmel needed no enforcement from his agonised face He raised his hand and pointed to the bed and his iron face was drawn and ashen white I felt my knees begin to tremble There on the bed seemingly in a swoon lay poor Lucy more horribly white and wanlooking than ever Even the lips were white and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him and he put it down again softly Quick he said Bring the brandy I flew to the diningroom and returned with the decanter He wetted the poor white lips with it and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart He felt her heart and after a few moments of agonising suspense said It is not too late It beats though but feebly All our work is undone we must begin again There is no young Arthur here now I have to call on you yourself this time friend John As he spoke he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirtsleeve There was no possibility of an opiate just at present and no need of one and so without a moments delay we began the operation After a timeit did not seem a short time either for the draining away of ones blood no matter how willingly it be given is a terrible feelingVan Helsing held up a warning finger Do not stir he said but I fear that with growing strength she may wake and that would make danger oh so much danger But I shall precaution take I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia He proceeded then swiftly and deftly to carry out his intent The effect on Lucy was not bad for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips No man knows till he experiences it what it is to feel his own lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves The Professor watched me critically That will do he said Already I remonstrated You took a great deal more from Art To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied He is her lover her fianc You have work much work to do for her and for others and the present will suffice When we stopped the operation he attended to Lucy whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision I laid down whilst I waited his leisure to attend to me for I felt faint and a little sick Byandby he bound up my wound and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself As I was leaving the room he came after me and half whispered Mind nothing must be said of this If our young lover should turn up unexpected as before no word to him It would at once frighten him and enjealous him too There must be none So When I came back he looked at me carefully and then said You are not much the worse Go into the room and lie on your sofa and rest awhile then have much breakfast and come here to me I followed out his orders for I knew how right and wise they were I had done my part and now my next duty was to keep up my strength I felt very weak and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred I fell asleep on the sofa however wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams for sleeping and waking my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged exhausted appearance of their edgestiny though they were Lucy slept well into the day and when she woke she was fairly well and strong though not nearly so much so as the day before When Van Helsing had seen her he went out for a walk leaving me in charge with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment I could hear his voice in the hall asking the way to the nearest telegraph office Lucy chatted with me freely and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened I tried to keep her amused and interested When her mother came up to see her she did not seem to notice any change whatever but said to me gratefully We owe you so much Dr Seward for all you have done but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself You are looking pale yourself You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit that you do As she spoke Lucy turned crimson though it was only momentarily for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me I smiled and nodded and laid my finger on my lips with a sigh she sank back amid her pillows Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours and presently said to me Now you go home and eat much and drink enough Make yourself strong I stay here tonight and I shall sit up with little miss myself You and I must watch the case and we must have none other to know I have grave reasons No do not ask them think what you will Do not fear to think even the most notprobable Goodnight In the hall two of the maids came to me and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy They implored me to let them and when I said it was Dr Van Helsings wish that either he or I should sit up they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the foreign gentleman I was much touched by their kindness Perhaps it is because I am weak at present and perhaps because it was on Lucys account that their devotion was manifested for over and over again have I seen similar instances of womans kindness I got back here in time for a late dinner went my roundsall well and set this down whilst waiting for sleep It is coming      11 SeptemberThis afternoon I went over to Hillingham Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits and Lucy much better Shortly after I had arrived a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor He opened it with much impressmentassumed of courseand showed a great bundle of white flowers These are for you Miss Lucy he said For me Oh Dr Van Helsing Yes my dear but not for you to play with These are medicines Here Lucy made a wry face Nay but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form so you need not snub that so charming nose or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort Aha my pretty miss that bring the so nice nose all straight again This is medicinal but you do not know how I put him in your window I make pretty wreath and hang him round your neck so that you sleep well Oh yes they like the lotus flower make your trouble forgotten It smell so like the waters of Lethe and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas and find him all too late Whilst he was speaking Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them Now she threw them down saying with halflaughter and halfdisgust Oh Professor I believe you are only putting up a joke on me Why these flowers are only common garlic To my surprise Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting No trifling with me I never jest There is grim purpose in all I do and I warn you that you do not thwart me Take care for the sake of others if not for your own Then seeing poor Lucy scared as she might well be he went on more gently Oh little miss my dear do not fear me I only do for your good but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers See I place them myself in your room I make myself the wreath that you are to wear But hush no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions We must obey and silence is a part of obedience and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you Now sit still awhile Come with me friend John and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic which is all the way from Haarlem where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glasshouses all the year I had to telegraph yesterday or they would not have been here We went into the room taking the flowers with us The Professors actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that I ever heard of First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely next taking a handful of the flowers he rubbed them all over the sashes as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door above below and at each side and round the fireplace in the same way It all seemed grotesque to me and presently I said Well Professor I know you always have a reason for what you do but this certainly puzzles me It is well we have no sceptic here or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit Perhaps I am he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck The last words he said to her were Take care you do not disturb it and even if the room feel close do not tonight open the window or the door I promise said Lucy and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me Oh what have I done to be blessed with such friends As we left the house in my fly which was waiting Van Helsing said Tonight I can sleep in peace and sleep I wanttwo nights of travel much reading in the day between and much anxiety on the day to follow and a night to sit up without to wink Tomorrow in the morning early you call for me and we come together to see our pretty miss so much more strong for my spell which I have work Ho ho He seemed so confident that I remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result felt awe and vague terror It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend but I felt it all the more like unshed tears CHAPTER XI Lucy Westenras Diary 12 SeptemberHow good they all are to me I quite love that dear Dr Van Helsing I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers He positively frightened me he was so fierce And yet he must have been right for I feel comfort from them already Somehow I do not dread being alone tonight and I can go to sleep without fear I shall not mind any flapping outside the window Oh the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late the pain of the sleeplessness or the pain of the fear of sleep with such unknown horrors as it has for me How blessed are some people whose lives have no fears no dreads to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly and brings nothing but sweet dreams Well here I am tonight hoping for sleep and lying like Ophelia in the play with virgin crants and maiden strewments I never liked garlic before but tonight it is delightful There is peace in its smell I feel sleep coming already Goodnight everybody Dr Sewards Diary 13 SeptemberCalled at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing as usual up to time The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting The Professor took his bag which he always brings with him now Let all be put down exactly Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight oclock It was a lovely morning the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of natures annual work The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours but had not yet begun to drop from the trees When we entered we met Mrs Westenra coming out of the morning room She is always an early riser She greeted us warmly and said You will be glad to know that Lucy is better The dear child is still asleep I looked into her room and saw her but did not go in lest I should disturb her The Professor smiled and looked quite jubilant He rubbed his hands together and said Aha I thought I had diagnosed the case My treatment is working to which she answered You must not take all the credit to yourself doctor Lucys state this morning is due in part to me How you do mean maam asked the Professor Well I was anxious about the dear child in the night and went into her room She was sleeping soundlyso soundly that even my coming did not wake her But the room was awfully stuffy There were a lot of those horrible strongsmelling flowers about everywhere and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air You will be pleased with her I am sure She moved off into her boudoir where she usually breakfasted early As she had spoken I watched the Professors face and saw it turn ashen grey He had been able to retain his selfcommand whilst the poor lady was present for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me suddenly and forcibly into the diningroom and closed the door Then for the first time in my life I saw Van Helsing break down He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair and then beat his palms together in a helpless way finally he sat down on a chair and putting his hands before his face began to sob with loud dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart Then he raised his arms again as though appealing to the whole universe God God God he said What have we done what has this poor thing done that we are so sore beset Is there fate amongst us still sent down from the pagan world of old that such things must be and in such way This poor mother all unknowing and all for the best as she think does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul and we must not tell her we must not even warn her or she die and then both die Oh how we are beset How are all the powers of the devils against us Suddenly he jumped to his feet Come he said come we must see and act Devils or no devils or all the devils at once it matters not we fight him all the same He went to the halldoor for his bag and together we went up to Lucys room Once again I drew up the blind whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful waxen pallor as before He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity As I expected he murmured with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much Without a word he went and locked the door and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood I had long ago recognised the necessity and begun to take off my coat but he stopped me with a warning hand No he said Today you must operate I shall provide You are weakened already As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirtsleeve Again the operation again the narcotic again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks and the regular breathing of healthy sleep This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs Westenra that she must not remove anything from Lucys room without consulting him that the flowers were of medicinal value and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure Then he took over the care of the case himself saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal What does it all mean I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain Lucy Westenras Diary 17 SeptemberFour days and nights of peace I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me I have a dim halfremembrance of long anxious times of waiting and fearing darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant and then long spells of oblivion and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water Since however Dr Van Helsing has been with me all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away the noises that used to frighten me out of my witsthe flapping against the windows the distant voices which seemed so close to me the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not whathave all ceased I go to bed now without any fear of sleep I do not even try to keep awake I have grown quite fond of the garlic and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem Tonight Dr Van Helsing is going away as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam But I need not be watched I am well enough to be left alone Thank God for mothers sake and dear Arthurs and for all our friends who have been so kind I shall not even feel the change for last night Dr Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time I found him asleep twice when I awoke but I did not fear to go to sleep again although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the windowpanes The Pall Mall Gazette 18 September THE ESCAPED WOLF PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER Interview with the Keeper in the Zological Gardens After many inquiries and almost as many refusals and perpetually using the words Pall Mall Gazette as a sort of talisman I managed to find the keeper of the section of the Zological Gardens in which the wolf department is included Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephanthouse and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk elderly and without children and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind their lives must be pretty comfortable The keeper would not enter on what he called business until the supper was over and we were all satisfied Then when the table was cleared and he had lit his pipe he said Now sir you can go on and arsk me what you want Youll excoose me refoosin to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk

and I that grumpylike that only for your bloomin arfquid Id a seen you blowed fust fore Id answer Not even when you arsked me sarcasticlike if Id like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions Without offence did I tell yer to go to ell You did An when you said youd report me for usin of obscene language that was ittin me over the ead but the arfquid made that all right I werent agoin to fight so I waited for the food and did with my owl as the wolves and lions and tigers does But Lor love yer art now that the old ooman has stuck a chunk of her teacake in me an rinsed me out with her bloomin old teapot and Ive lit hup you may scratch my ears for all youre worth and wont git even a growl out of me Drive along with your questions I know what yer acomin at that ere escaped wolf Exactly I want you to give me your view of it Just tell me how it happened and when I know the facts Ill get you to say what you consider was the cause of it and how you think the whole affair will end All right guvnor This ere is about the ole story That ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from Norway to Jamrachs which we bought off him four years ago He was a nice wellbehaved wolf that never gave no trouble to talk of Im more surprised at im for wantin to get out nor any other animile in the place But there you cant trust wolves no more nor women Dont you mind him sir broke in Mrs Tom with a cheery laugh Es got mindin the animiles so long that blest if he aint like a old wolf isself But there aint no arm in im Well sir it was about two hours after feedin yesterday when I first hear my disturbance I was makin up a litter in the monkeyhouse for a young puma which is ill but when I heard the yelpin and owlin I kem away straight There was Bersicker atearin like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out There wasnt much people about that day and close at hand was only one man a tall thin chap with a ook nose and a pointed beard with a few white hairs runnin through it He had a ard cold look and red eyes and I took a sort of mislike to him for it seemed as if it was im as they was hirritated at He ad white kid gloves on is ands and he pointed out the animiles to me and says Keeper these wolves seem upset at something Maybe its you says I for I did not like the airs as he give isself He didnt git angry as I oped he would but he smiled a kind of insolent smile with a mouth full of white sharp teeth Oh no they wouldnt like me e says Ow yes they would says I aimitatin of him They always likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on about teatime which you as a bagful Well it was a odd thing but when the animiles see us atalkin they lay down and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever That there man kem over and blessed but if he didnt put in his hand and stroke the old wolfs ears too Tyke care says I Bersicker is quick Never mind he says Im used to em Are you in the business yourself I says tyking off my at for a man what trades in wolves anceterer is a good friend to keepers No says he not exactly in the business but I ave made pets of several And with that he lifts his at as perlite as a lord and walks away Old Bersicker kep alookin arter im till e was out of sight and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldnt come hout the ole hevening Well larst night so soon as the moon was hup the wolves here all began aowling There warnt nothing for them to owl at There warnt no one near except some one that was evidently acallin a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road Once or twice I went out to see that all was right and it was and then the owling stopped Just before twelve oclock I just took a look round afore turnin in an bust me but when I kem opposite to old Bersickers cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty And thats all I know for certing Did any one else see anything One of our gardners was acomin ome about that time from a armony when he sees a big grey dog comin out through the garding edges At least so he says but I dont give much for it myself for if he did e never said a word about it to his missis when e got ome and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known and we had been up all nightahuntin of the Park for Bersicker that he remembered seein anything My own belief was that the armony ad got into his ead Now Mr Bilder can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf Well sir he said with a suspicious sort of modesty I think I can but I dont know as ow youd be satisfied with the theory Certainly I shall If a man like you who knows the animals from experience cant hazard a good guess at any rate who is even to try Well then sir I accounts for it this way it seems to me that ere wolf escapedsimply because he wanted to get out From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I could see that it had done service before and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell I couldnt cope in badinage with the worthy Thomas but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart so I said Now Mr Bilder well consider that first halfsovereign worked off and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when youve told me what you think will happen Right yare sir he said briskly Yell excoose me I know for achaffin of ye but the old woman here winked at me which was as much as telling me to go on Well I never said the old lady My opinion is this that ere wolf is aidin of somewheres The gardner wot didnt remember said he was agallopin northward faster than a horse could go but I dont believe him for yer see sir wolves dont gallop no more nor dogs does they not bein built that way Wolves is fine things in a storybook and I dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin somethin thats more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up whatever it is But Lor bless you in real life a wolf is only a low creature not half so clever or bold as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fight in im This one aint been used to fightin or even to providin for hisself and more like hes somewhere round the Park aidin an ashiverin of and if he thinks at all wonderin where he is to get his breakfast from or maybe hes got down some area and is in a coalcellar My eye wont some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes ashining at her out of the dark If he cant get food hes bound to look for it and mayhap he may chance to light on a butchers shop in time If he doesnt and some nursemaid goes awalkin orf with a soldier leavin of the hinfant in the perambulatorwell then I shouldnt be surprised if the census is one babby the less Thats all I was handing him the halfsovereign when something came bobbing up against the window and Mr Bilders face doubled its natural length with surprise God bless me he said If there aint old Bersicker come back by isself He went to the door and opened it a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea After all however there is nothing like custom for neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog The animal itself was as peaceful and wellbehaved as that father of all picturewolvesRed Riding Hoods quondam friend whilst moving her confidence in masquerade The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos The wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes was there in a sort of penitent mood and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude and when he had finished with his penitent said There I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble didnt I say it all along Heres his head all cut and full of broken glass Es been agettin over some bloomin wall or other Its a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles This eres what comes of it Come along Bersicker He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage with a piece of meat that satisfied in quantity at any rate the elementary conditions of the fatted calf and went off to report I came off too to report the only exclusive information that is given today regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo Dr Sewards Diary 17 SeptemberI was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books which through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy had fallen sadly into arrear Suddenly the door was burst open and in rushed my patient with his face distorted with passion I was thunderstruck for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the Superintendents study is almost unknown Without an instants pause he made straight at me He had a dinnerknife in his hand and as I saw he was dangerous I tried to keep the table between us He was too quick and too strong for me however for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely Before he could strike again however I got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor My wrist bled freely and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort and occupied myself binding up my wrist keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time When the attendants rushed in and we turned our attention to him his employment positively sickened me He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up like a dog the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist He was easily secured and to my surprise went with the attendants quite placidly simply repeating over and over again The blood is the life The blood is the life I cannot afford to lose blood just at present I have lost too much of late for my physical good and then the prolonged strain of Lucys illness and its horrible phases is telling on me I am overexcited and weary and I need rest rest rest Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me so I need not forego my sleep tonight I could not well do without it Telegram Van Helsing Antwerp to Seward Carfax Sent to Carfax Sussex as no county given delivered late by twentytwo hours 17 SeptemberDo not fail to be at Hillingham tonight If not watching all the time frequently visit and see that flowers are as placed very important do not fail Shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival Dr Sewards Diary 18 SeptemberJust off for train to London The arrival of Van Helsings telegram filled me with dismay A whole night lost and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night Of course it is possible that all may be well but what may have happened Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do I shall take this cylinder with me and then I can complete my entry on Lucys phonograph Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra 17 September NightI write this and leave it to be seen so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me This is an exact record of what took place tonight I feel I am dying of weakness and have barely strength to write but it must be done if I die in the doing I went to bed as usual taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr Van Helsing directed and soon fell asleep I was waked by the flapping at the window which had begun after that sleepwalking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me and which now I know so well I was not afraid but I did wish that Dr Seward was in the next roomas Dr Van Helsing said he would beso that I might have called him I tried to go to sleep but could not Then there came to me the old fear of sleep and I determined to keep awake Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it so as I feared to be alone I opened my door and called out Is there anybody there There was no answer I was afraid to wake mother and so closed my door again Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dogs but more fierce and deeper I went to the window and looked out but could see nothing except a big bat which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window So I went back to bed again but determined not to go to sleep Presently the door opened and mother looked in seeing by my moving that I was not asleep came in and sat by me She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont I was uneasy about you darling and came in to see that you were all right I feared she might catch cold sitting there and asked her to come in and sleep with me so she came into bed and lay down beside me she did not take off her dressing gown for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed As she lay there in my arms and I in hers the flapping and buffeting came to the window again She was startled and a little frightened and cried out What is that I tried to pacify her and at last succeeded and she lay quiet but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly After a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery and shortly after there was a crash at the window and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great gaunt grey wolf Mother cried out in a fright and struggled up into a sitting posture and clutched wildly at anything that would help her Amongst other things she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck and tore it away from me For a second or two she sat up pointing at the wolf and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat then she fell overas if struck with lightning and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two The room and all round seemed to spin round I kept my eyes fixed on the window but the wolf drew his head back and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert I tried to stir but there was some spell upon me and dear mothers poor body which seemed to grow cold alreadyfor her dear heart had ceased to beatweighed me down and I remembered no more for a while The time did not seem long but very very awful till I recovered consciousness again Somewhere near a passing bell was tolling the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling and in our shrubbery seemingly just outside a nightingale was singing I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids too for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door I called to them and they came in and when they saw what had happened and what it was that lay over me on the bed they screamed out The wind rushed in through the broken window and the door slammed to They lifted off the body of my dear mother and laid her covered up with a sheet on the bed after I had got up They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the diningroom and have each a glass of wine The door flew open for an instant and closed again The maids shrieked and then went in a body to the diningroom and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mothers breast When they were there I remembered what Dr Van Helsing had told me but I didnt like to remove them and besides I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now I was surprised that the maids did not come back I called them but got no answer so I went to the diningroom to look for them My heart sank when I saw what had happened They all four lay helpless on the floor breathing heavily The decanter of sherry was on the table half full but there was a queer acrid smell about I was suspicious and examined the decanter It smelt of laudanum and looking on the sideboard I found that the bottle which mothers doctor uses for heroh did usewas empty What am I to do what am I to do I am back in the room with mother I cannot leave her and I am alone save for the sleeping servants whom some one has drugged Alone with the dead I dare not go out for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window The air seems full of specks floating and circling in the draught from the window and the lights burn blue and dim What am I to do God shield me from harm this night I shall hide this paper in my breast where they shall find it when they come to lay me out My dear mother gone It is time that I go too Goodbye dear Arthur if I should not survive this night God keep you dear and God help me CHAPTER XII DR SEWARDS DIARY 18 SeptemberI drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early Keeping my cab at the gate I went up the avenue alone I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother and hoped to only bring a servant to the door After a while finding no response I knocked and rang again still no answer I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hourfor it was now ten oclockand so rang and knocked again but more impatiently but still without response Hitherto I had blamed only the servants but now a terrible fear began to assail me Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come too late I knew that minutes even seconds of delay might mean hours of danger to Lucy if she had had again one of those frightful relapses and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere I could find no means of ingress Every window and door was fastened and locked and I returned baffled to the porch As I did so I heard the rapid pitpat of a swiftly driven horses feet They stopped at the gate and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue When he saw me he gasped out Then it was you and just arrived How is she Are we too late Did you not get my telegram I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his telegram early in the morning and had not lost a minute in coming here and that I could not make any one in the house hear me He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly Then I fear we are too late Gods will be done With his usual recuperative energy he went on Come If there be no way open to get in we must make one Time is all in all to us now We went round to the back of the house where there was a kitchen window The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case and handing it to me pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them Then with a long thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window I helped the Professor in and followed him There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants rooms which were close at hand We tried all the rooms as we went along and in the diningroom dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters found four servantwomen lying on the floor There was no need to think them dead for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition Van Helsing and I looked at each other and as we moved away he said We can attend to them later Then we ascended to Lucys room For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen but there was no sound that we could hear With white faces and trembling hands we opened the door gently and entered the room How shall I describe what we saw On the bed lay two women Lucy and her mother The latter lay farthest in and she was covered with a white sheet the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window showing the drawn white face with a look of terror fixed upon it By her side lay Lucy with face white and still more drawn The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mothers bosom and her throat was bare showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before but looking horribly white and mangled Without a word the Professor bent over the bed his head almost touching poor Lucys breast then he gave a quick turn of his head as of one who listens and leaping to his feet he cried out to me It is not yet too late Quick quick Bring the brandy I flew downstairs and returned with it taking care to smell and taste it lest it too were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found on the table The maids were still breathing but more restlessly and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off I did not stay to make sure but returned to Van Helsing He rubbed the brandy as on another occasion on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands He said to me I can do this all that can be at the present You go wake those maids Flick them in the face with a wet towel and flick them hard Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her She will need be heated before we can do anything more I went at once and found little difficulty in waking three of the women The fourth was only a young girl and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep The others were dazed at first but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner I was stern with them however and would not let them talk I told them that one life was bad enough to lose and that if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy So sobbing and crying they went about their way half clad as they were and prepared fire and water Fortunately the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive and there was no lack of hot water We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door One of the maids ran off hurried on some more clothes and opened it Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr Holmwood I bade her simply tell him that he must wait for we could see no one now She went away with the message and engrossed with our work I clean forgot all about him I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest I knewas he knewthat it was a standup fight with death and in a pause told him so He answered me in a way that I did not understand but with the sternest look that his face could wear If that were all I would stop here where we are now and let her fade away into peace for I see no light in life over her horizon He went on with his work with if possible renewed and more frenzied vigour Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect Lucys heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope and her lungs had a perceptible movement Van Helsings face almost beamed and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me The first gain is ours Check to the King We took Lucy into another room which had by now been prepared and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat She was still unconscious and was quite as bad as if not worse than we had ever seen her Van Helsing called in one of the women and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned and then beckoned me out of the room We must consult as to what is to be done he said as we descended the stairs In the hall he opened the diningroom door and we passed in he closing the door carefully behind him The shutters had been opened but the blinds were already down with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes The room was therefore dimly dark It was however light enough for our purposes Van Helsings sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity He was evidently torturing his mind about something so I waited for an instant and he spoke What are we to do now Where are we to turn for help We must have another transfusion of blood and that soon or that poor girls life wont be worth an hours purchase You are exhausted already I am exhausted too I fear to trust those women even if they would have courage to submit What are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her Whats the matter with me anyhow The voice came from the sofa across the room and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart for they were those of Quincey Morris Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out Quincey Morris and rushed towards him with outstretched hands What brought you here I cried as our hands met I guess Art is the cause He handed me a telegram Have not heard from Seward for three days and am terribly anxious Cannot leave Father still in same condition Send me word how Lucy is Do not delayHOLMWOOD I think I came just in the nick of time You know you have only to tell me what to do Van Helsing strode forward and took his hand looking him straight in the eyes as he said A brave mans blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble Youre a man and no mistake Well the devil may work against us for all hes worth but God sends us men when we want them Once again we went through that ghastly operation I have not the heart to go through with the details Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before for though plenty of blood went into her veins her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear However the action of both heart and lungs improved and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia as before and with good effect Her faint became a profound slumber The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast Then a thought struck me and I went back to the room where Lucy now was When I came softly in I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of notepaper in his hand He had evidently read it and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face as of one who has had a doubt solved He handed me the paper saying only It dropped from Lucys breast when we carried her to the bath When I had read it I stood looking at the Professor and after a pause asked him In Gods name what does it all mean Was she or is she mad or what sort of horrible danger is it I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper saying Do not trouble about it now Forget it for the present You shall know and understand it all in good time but it will be later And now what is it that you came to me to say This brought me back to fact and I was all myself again I came to speak about the certificate of death If we do not act properly and wisely there may be an inquest and that paper would have to be produced I am in hopes that we need have no inquest for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy if nothing else did I know and you know and the other doctor who attended her knows that Mrs Westenra had disease of the heart and we can certify that she died of it Let us fill up the certificate at once and I shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker Good oh my friend John Well thought of Truly Miss Lucy if she be sad in the foes that beset her is at least happy in the friends that love her One two three all open their veins for her besides one old man Ah yes I know friend John I am not blind I love you all the more for it Now go In the hall I met Quincey Morris with a telegram for Arthur telling him that Mrs Westenra was dead that Lucy also had been ill but was now going on better and that Van Helsing and I were with her I told him where I was going and he hurried me out but as I was going said When you come back Jack may I have two words with you all to ourselves I nodded in reply and went out I found no difficulty about the registration and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements When I got back Quincey was waiting for me I told him I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy and went up to her room She was still sleeping and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side From his putting his finger to his lips I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfastroom where the blinds were not drawn down and which was a little more cheerful or rather less cheerless than the other rooms When we were alone he said to me Jack Seward I dont want to shove myself in anywhere where Ive no right to be but this is no ordinary case You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her but although thats all past and gone I cant help feeling anxious about her all the same What is it thats wrong with her The Dutchmanand a fine old fellow he is I can see thatsaid that time you two came into the room that you must have another transfusion of blood and that both you and he were exhausted Now I know well that you medical men speak in camera and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private But this is no common matter and whatever it is I have done my part Is not that so Thats so I said and he went on I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did today Is not that so Thats so And I guess Art was in it too When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night and what with his gorge and the vein left open there wasnt enough blood in her to let her stand up and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay Jack if you may tell me without betraying confidence Arthur was the first is not that so As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain His very heart was bleeding and it took all the manhood of himand there was a royal lot of it tooto keep him from breaking down I paused before answering for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret but already he knew so much and guessed so much that there could be no reason for not answering so I answered in the same phrase Thats so And how long has this been going on About ten days Ten days Then I guess Jack Seward that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men Man alive her whole body wouldnt hold it Then coming close to me he spoke in a fierce halfwhisper What took it out I shook my head That I said is the crux Van Helsing is simply frantic about it and I am at my wits end I cant even hazard a guess There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched But these shall not occur again Here we stay until all be wellor ill Quincey held out his hand Count me in he said You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do and Ill do it When she woke late in the afternoon Lucys first movement was to feel in her breast and to my surprise produced the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from lest on waking she should be alarmed Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too and gladdened Then she looked around the room and seeing where she was shuddered she gave a loud cry and put her poor thin hands before her pale face We both understood what that meantthat she had realised to the full her mothers death so we tried what we could to comfort her Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat but she was very low in thought and spirit and wept silently and weakly for a long time We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time and that seemed to comfort her Towards dusk she fell into a doze Here a very odd thing occurred Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her All the same however she went on with the action of tearing as though the material were still in her hands finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments Van Helsing seemed surprised and his brows gathered as if in thought but he said nothing      19 SeptemberAll last night she slept fitfully being always afraid to sleep and something weaker when she woke from it The Professor and I took it in turns to watch and we never left her for a moment unattended Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention but I knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house When the day came its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucys strength She was hardly able to turn her head and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good At times she slept and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her between sleeping and waking Whilst asleep she looked stronger although more haggard and her breathing was softer her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression for she looked her own self although a dying one In the afternoon she asked for Arthur and we telegraphed for him Quincey went off to meet him at the station When he arrived it was nearly six oclock and the sun was setting full and warm and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks When he saw her Arthur was simply choking with emotion and none of us could speak In the hours that had passed the fits of sleep or the comatose condition that passed for it had grown more frequent so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened Arthurs presence however seemed to act as a stimulant she rallied a little and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived He too pulled himself together and spoke as cheerily as he could so that the best was made of everything It was now nearly one oclock and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour and I am entering this on Lucys phonograph Until six oclock they are to try to rest I fear that tomorrow will end our watching for the shock has been too great the poor child cannot rally God help us all Letter Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra Unopened by her 17 September My dearest Lucy It seems an age since I heard from you or indeed since I wrote You will pardon me I know for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news Well I got my husband back all right when we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us and in it though he had an attack of gout Mr Hawkins He took us to his house where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable and we dined together After dinner Mr Hawkins said My dears I want to drink your health and prosperity and may every blessing attend you both I know you both from children and have with love and pride seen you grow up Now I want you to make your home here with me I have left to me neither chick nor child all are gone and in my will I have left you everything I cried Lucy dear as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands Our evening was a very very happy one So here we are installed in this beautiful old house and from both my bedroom and the drawingroom I can see the great elms of the cathedral close with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day after the manner of rooksand humans I am busy I need not tell you arranging things and housekeeping Jonathan and Mr Hawkins are busy all day for now that Jonathan is a partner Mr Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients How is your dear mother getting on I wish I could run up to town for a day or two to see you dear but I dare not go yet with so much on my shoulders and Jonathan wants looking after still He is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again but he was terribly weakened by the long illness even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity However thank God these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on and they will in time pass away altogether I trust And now I have told you my news let me ask yours When are you to be married and where and who is to perform the ceremony and what are you to wear and is it to be a public or a private wedding Tell me all about it dear tell me all about everything for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me Jonathan asks me to send his respectful duty but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins  Harker and so as you love me and he loves me and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb I send you simply his love instead Goodbye my dearest Lucy and all blessings on you Yours MINA HARKER Report from Patrick Hennessey M D M R C S L K Q C P I etc etc to John Seward M D 20 September My dear Sir In accordance with your wishes I enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge With regard to patient Renfield there is more to say He has had another outbreak which might have had a dreadful ending but which as it fortunately happened was unattended with any unhappy results This afternoon a carriers cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on oursthe house to which you will remember the patient twice ran away The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way as they were strangers I was myself looking out of the study window having a smoke after dinner and saw one of them come up to the house As he passed the window of Renfields room the patient began to rate him from within and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to The man who seemed a decent fellow enough contented himself by telling him to shut up for a foulmouthed beggar whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying Lor bless yer sir I wouldnt mind what was said to me in a bloomin madhouse I pity ye and the guvnor for havin to live in the house with a wild beast like that Then he asked his way civilly enough and I told him where the gate of the empty house was he went away followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger since he is usually such a wellbehaved man and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred I found him to my astonishment quite composed and most genial in his manner I tried to get him to talk of the incident but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair It was I am sorry to say however only another instance of his cunning for within half an hour I heard of him again This time he had broken out through the window of his room and was running down the avenue I called to the attendants to follow me and ran after him for I feared he was intent on some mischief My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road having on it some great wooden boxes The men were wiping their foreheads and were flushed in the face as if with violent exercise Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them and pulling one of them off the cart began to knock his head against the ground If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the buttend of his heavy whip It was a terrible blow but he did not seem to mind it but seized him also and struggled with the three of us pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens You know I am no light weight and the others were both burly men At first he was silent in his fighting but as we began to master him and the attendants were putting a straitwaistcoat on him he began to shout Ill frustrate them They shant rob me they shant murder me by inches Ill fight for my Lord and Master and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room One of the attendants Hardy had a finger broken However I set it all right and he is going on well The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us Their threats were however mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment I quite understood their drift and after a stiff glass of grog or rather more of the same and with each a sovereign in hand they made light of the attack and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so bloomin good a bloke as your correspondent I took their names and addresses in case they might be needed They are as followsJack Smollet of Duddings Rents King Georges Road Great Walworth and Thomas Snelling Peter Farleys Row Guide Court Bethnal Green They are both in the employment of Harris  Sons Moving and Shipment Company Orange Masters Yard Soho I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here and shall wire you at once if there is anything of importance Believe me dear Sir Yours faithfully PATRICK HENNESSEY Letter Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra Unopened by her 18 September My dearest Lucy Such a sad blow has befallen us Mr Hawkins has died very suddenly Some may not think it so sad for us but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father I never knew either father or mother so that the dear old mans death is a real blow to me Jonathan is greatly distressed It is not only that he feels sorrow deep sorrow for the dear good man who has befriended him all his life and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice but Jonathan feels it on another account He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous He begins to doubt himself I try to cheer him up and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most Oh it is too hard that a sweet simple noble strong nature such as hisa nature which enabled him by our dear good friends aid to rise from clerk to master in a few yearsshould be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone Forgive me dear if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness but Lucy dear I must tell some one for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me and I have no one here that I can confide in I dread coming up to London as we must do the day after tomorrow for poor Mr Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father As there are no relations at all Jonathan will have to be chief mourner I shall try to run over to see you dearest if only for a few minutes Forgive me for troubling you With all blessings Your loving MINA HARKER Dr Sewards Diary 20 SeptemberOnly resolution and habit can let me make an entry tonight I am too miserable too lowspirited too sick of the world and all in it including life itself that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of lateLucys mother and Arthurs father and now Let me get on with my work I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy We wanted Arthur to go to rest also but he refused at first It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day and that we must not all break down for want of rest lest Lucy should suffer that he agreed to go Van Helsing was very kind to him Come my child he said come with me You are sick and weak and have had much sorrow and much mental pain as well as that tax on your strength that we know of You must not be alone for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms Come to the drawingroom where there is a big fire and there are two sofas You shall lie on one and I on the other and our sympathy will be comfort to each other even though we do not speak and even if we sleep Arthur went off with him casting back a longing look on Lucys face which lay in her pillow almost whiter than the lawn She lay quite still and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room as in the other his purpose of using the garlic the whole of the windowsashes reeked with it and round Lucys neck over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously and her face was at its worst for the open mouth showed the pale gums Her teeth in the dim uncertain light seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning In particular by some trick of the light the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest I sat down by her and presently she moved uneasily At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window I went over to it softly and peeped out by the corner of the blind There was a full moonlight and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat which wheeled rounddoubtless attracted by the light although so dimand every now and again struck the window with its wings When I came back to my seat I found that Lucy had moved slightly and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat I replaced them as well as I could and sat watching her Presently she woke and I gave her food as Van Helsing had prescribed She took but a little and that languidly There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state with the stertorous breathing she put the flowers from her but that when she waked she clutched them close There was no possibility of making any mistake about this for in the long hours that followed she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times At six oclock Van Helsing came to relieve me Arthur had then fallen into a doze and he mercifully let him sleep on When he saw Lucys face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath and he said to me in a sharp whisper Draw up the blind I want light Then he bent down and with his face almost touching Lucys examined her carefully He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat As he did so he started back and I could hear his ejaculation Mein Gott as it was smothered in his throat I bent over and looked too and as I noticed some queer chill came over me The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her with his face at its sternest Then he turned to me and said calmly She is dying It will not be long now It will be much difference mark me whether she dies conscious or in her sleep Wake that poor boy and let him come and see the last he trusts us and we have promised him I went to the diningroom and waked him He was dazed for a moment but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late and expressed his fear I assured him that Lucy was still asleep but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near He covered his face with his hands and slid down on his knees by the sofa where he remained perhaps a minute with his head buried praying whilst his shoulders shook with grief I took him by the hand and raised him up Come I said my dear old fellow summon all your fortitude it will be best and easiest for her When we came into Lucys room I could see that Van Helsing had with his usual forethought been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible He had even brushed Lucys hair so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples When we came into the room she opened her eyes and seeing him whispered softly Arthur Oh my love I am so glad you have come He was stooping to kiss her when Van Helsing motioned him back No he whispered not yet Hold her hand it will comfort her more So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her and she looked her best with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes Then gradually her eyes closed and she sank to sleep For a little bit her breast heaved softly and her breath came and went like a tired childs And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night Her breathing grew stertorous the mouth opened and the pale gums drawn back made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever In a sort of sleepwaking vague unconscious way she opened her eyes which were now dull and hard at once and said in a soft voluptuous voice such as I had never heard from her lips Arthur Oh my love I am so glad you have come Kiss me Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her but at that instant Van Helsing who like me had been startled by her voice swooped upon him and catching him by the neck with both hands dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed and actually hurled him almost across the room Not for your life he said not for your living soul and hers And he stood between them like a lion at bay Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion and stood silent waiting I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy as did Van Helsing and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face the sharp teeth champed together Then her eyes closed and she breathed heavily Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness and putting out her poor pale thin hand took Van Helsings great brown one drawing it to her she kissed it My true friend she said in a faint voice but with untellable pathos My true friend and his Oh guard him and give me peace I swear it he said solemnly kneeling beside her and holding up his hand as one who registers an oath Then he turned to Arthur and said to him Come my child take her hand in yours and kiss her on the forehead and only once Their eyes met instead of their lips and so they parted Lucys eyes closed and Van Helsing who had been watching closely took Arthurs arm and drew him away And then Lucys breathing became stertorous again and all at once it ceased It is all over said Van Helsing She is dead I took Arthur by the arm and led him away to the drawingroom where he sat down and covered his face with his hands sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see I went back to the room and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy and his face was sterner than ever Some change had come over her body Death had given back part of her beauty for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines even the lips had lost their deadly pallor It was as if the blood no longer needed for the working of the heart had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be We thought her dying whilst she slept And sleeping when she died I stood beside Van Helsing and said Ah well poor girl there is peace for her at last It is the end He turned to me and said with grave solemnity Not so alas not so It is only the beginning When I asked him what he meant he only shook his head and answered We can do nothing as yet Wait and see CHAPTER XIII DR SEWARDS DIARYcontinued The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together I attended to all the ghastly formalities and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflictedor blessedwith something of his own obsequious suavity Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me in a confidential brotherprofessional way when she had come out from the deathchamber She makes a very beautiful corpse sir Its quite a privilege to attend on her Its not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household There were no relatives at hand and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his fathers funeral we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden Under the circumstances Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers etc He insisted upon looking over Lucys papers himself I asked him why for I feared that he being a foreigner might not be quite aware of English legal requirements and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble He answered me I know I know You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor But this is not altogether for the law You knew that when you avoided the coroner I have more than him to avoid There may be papers moresuch as this As he spoke he took from his pocketbook the memorandum which had been in Lucys breast and which she had torn in her sleep When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs Westenra seal all her papers and write him tonight For me I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucys old room all night and I myself search for what may be It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers I went on with my part of the work and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs Westenras solicitor and had written to him All the poor ladys papers were in order explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given I had hardly sealed the letter when to my surprise Van Helsing walked into the room saying Can I help you friend John I am free and if I may my service is to you Have you got what you looked for I asked to which he replied I did not look for any specific thing I only hoped to find and find I have all that there wasonly some letters and a few memoranda and a diary new begun But I have them here and we shall for the present say nothing of them I shall see that poor lad tomorrow evening and with his sanction I shall use some When we had finished the work in hand he said to me And now friend John I think we may to bed We want sleep both you and I and rest to recuperate Tomorrow we shall have much to do but for the tonight there is no need of us Alas Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy The undertaker had certainly done his work well for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers and death was made as little repulsive as might be The end of the windingsheet was laid over the face when the Professor bent over and turned it gently back we both started at the beauty before us the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well All Lucys loveliness had come back to her in death and the hours that had passed instead of leaving traces of decays effacing fingers had but restored the beauty of life till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse The Professor looked sternly grave He had not loved her as I had and there was no need for tears in his eyes He said to me Remain till I return and left the room He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall but which had not been opened and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed Then he took from his neck inside his collar a little gold crucifix and placed it over the mouth He restored the sheet to its place and we came away I was undressing in my own room when with a premonitory tap at the door he entered and at once began to speak Tomorrow I want you to bring me before night a set of postmortem knives Must we make an autopsy I asked Yes and no I want to operate but not as you think Let me tell you now but not a word to another I want to cut off her head and take out her heart Ah you a surgeon and so shocked You whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder Oh but I must not forget my dear friend John that you loved her and I have not forgotten it for it is I that shall operate and you must only help I would like to do it tonight but for Arthur I must not he will be free after his fathers funeral tomorrow and he will want to see herto see it Then when she is coffined ready for the next day you and I shall come when all sleep We shall unscrew the coffinlid and shall do our operation and then replace all so that none know save we alone But why do it at all The girl is dead Why mutilate her poor body without need And if there is no necessity for a postmortem and nothing to gain by itno good to her to us to science to human knowledgewhy do it Without such it is monstrous For answer he put his hand on my shoulder and said with infinite tenderness Friend John I pity your poor bleeding heart and I love you the more because it does so bleed If I could I would take on myself the burden that you do bear But there are things that you know not but that you shall know and bless me for knowing though they are not pleasant things John my child you have been my friend now many years and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause I may errI am but man but I believe in all I do Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came Yes Were you not amazed nay horrified when I would not let Arthur kiss his lovethough she was dyingand snatched him away by all my strength Yes And yet you saw how she thanked me with her so beautiful dying eyes her voice too so weak and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me Yes And did you not hear me swear promise to her that so she closed her eyes grateful Yes Well I have good reason now for all I want to do You have for many years trust me you have believe me weeks past when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt Believe me yet a little friend John If you trust me not then I must tell what I think and that is not perhaps well And if I workas work I shall no matter trust or no trustwithout my friend trust in me I work with heavy heart and feel oh so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be He paused a moment and went on solemnly Friend John there are strange and terrible days before us Let us not be two but one that so we work to a good end Will you not have faith in me I took his hand and promised him I held my door open as he went away and watched him go into his room and close the door As I stood without moving I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passageshe had her back towards me so did not see meand go into the room where Lucy lay The sight touched me Devotion is so rare and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest      I must have slept long and soundly for it was broad daylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room He came over to my bedside and said You need not trouble about the knives we shall not do it Why not I asked For his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me Because he said sternly it is too lateor too early See Here he held up the little golden crucifix This was stolen in the night How stolen I asked in wonder since you have it now Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it from the woman who robbed the dead and the living Her punishment will surely come but not through me she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing she only stole Now we must wait He went away on the word leaving me with a new mystery to think of a new puzzle to grapple with The forenoon was a dreary time but at noon the solicitor came Mr Marquand of Wholeman Sons Marquand  Lidderdale He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done and took off our hands all cares as to details During lunch he told us that Mrs Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart and had put her affairs in absolute order he informed us that with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucys fathers which now in default of direct issue went back to a distant branch of the family the whole estate real and personal was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood When he had told us so much he went on Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance Indeed we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes Of course we had then no alternative but to accept We were right in principle and ninetynine times out of a hundred we should have proved by the logic of events the accuracy of our judgment Frankly however I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property and even had she only survived her mother by five minutes her property would in case there were no willand a will was a practical impossibility in such a casehave been treated at her decease as under intestacy In which case Lord Godalming though so dear a friend would have had no claim in the world and the inheritors being remote would not be likely to abandon their just rights for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger I assure you my dear sirs I am rejoiced at the result perfectly rejoiced He was a good fellow but his rejoicing at the one little partin which he was officially interestedof so great a tragedy was an objectlesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding He did not remain long but said he would look in later in the day and see Lord Godalming His coming however had been a certain comfort to us since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts Arthur was expected at five oclock so a little before that time we visited the deathchamber It was so in very truth for now both mother and daughter lay in it The undertaker true to his craft had made the best display he could of his goods and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to explaining that as Lord Godalming was coming very soon it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiance quite alone The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved Poor fellow He looked desperately sad and broken even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his muchtried emotions He had I knew been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father and to lose him and at such a time was a bitter blow to him With me he was warm as ever and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous but I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him The Professor noticed it too and motioned me to bring him upstairs I did so and left him at the door of the room as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her but he took my arm and led me in saying huskily You loved her too old fellow she told me all about it and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you I dont know how to thank you for all you have done for her I cant think yet Here he suddenly broke down and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast crying Oh Jack Jack What shall I do The whole of life seems gone from me all at once and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for I comforted him as well as I could In such cases men do not need much expression A grip of the hand the tightening of an arm over the shoulder a sob in unison are expressions of sympathy dear to a mans heart I stood still and silent till his sobs died away and then I said softly to him Come and look at her Together we moved over to the bed and I lifted the lawn from her face God how beautiful she was Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness It frightened and amazed me somewhat and as for Arthur he fell atrembling and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague At last after a long pause he said to me in a faint whisper Jack is she really dead I assured him sadly that it was so and went on to suggestfor I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I could helpthat it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering It seemed to quite do away with any doubt and after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long he turned aside I told him that that must be goodbye as the coffin had to be prepared so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it and bent over and kissed her forehead He came away fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came I left him in the drawingroom and told Van Helsing that he had said goodbye so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertakers men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin When he came out of the room again I told him of Arthurs question and he replied I am not surprised Just now I doubted for a moment myself We all dined together and I could see that poor Art was trying to make the best of things Van Helsing had been silent all dinnertime but when we had lit our cigars he said Lord but Arthur interrupted him No no not that for Gods sake not yet at any rate Forgive me sir I did not mean to speak offensively it is only because my loss is so recent The Professor answered very sweetly I only used that name because I was in doubt I must not call you Mr and I have grown to love youyes my dear boy to love youas Arthur Arthur held out his hand and took the old mans warmly Call me what you will he said I hope I may always have the title of a friend And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear He paused a moment and went on I know that she understood your goodness even better than I do and if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted soyou rememberthe Professor noddedyou must forgive me He answered with a grave kindness I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then for to trust such violence needs to understand and I take it that you do notthat you cannottrust me now for you do not yet understand And there may be more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannotand may notand must not yet understand But the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect And indeed indeed sir said Arthur warmly I shall in all ways trust you I know and believe you have a very noble heart and you are Jacks friend and you were hers You shall do what you like The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times as though about to speak and finally said May I ask you something now Certainly You know that Mrs Westenra left you all her property No poor dear I never thought of it And as it is all yours you have a right to deal with it as you will I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucys papers and letters Believe me it is no idle curiosity I have a motive of which be sure she would have approved I have them all here I took them before we knew that all was yours so that no strange hand might touch themno strange eye look through words into her soul I shall keep them if I may even you may not see them yet but I shall keep them safe No word shall be lost and in the good time I shall give them back to you Its a hard thing I ask but you will do it will you not for Lucys sake Arthur spoke out heartily like his old self Dr Van Helsing you may do what you will I feel that in saying this I am doing what my dear one would have approved I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly And you are right There will be pain for us all but it will not be all pain nor will this pain be the last We and you tooyou most of all my dear boywill have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet But we must be brave of heart and unselfish and do our duty and all will be well I slept on a sofa in Arthurs room that night Van Helsing did not go to bed at all He went to and fro as if patrolling the house and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin strewn with the wild garlic flowers which sent through the odour of lily and rose a heavy overpowering smell into the night Mina Harkers Journal 22 SeptemberIn the train to Exeter Jonathan sleeping It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made and yet how much between then in Whitby and all the world before me Jonathan away and no news of him and now married to Jonathan Jonathan a solicitor a partner rich master of his business Mr Hawkins dead and buried and Jonathan with another attack that may harm him Some day he may ask me about it Down it all goes I am rusty in my shorthandsee what unexpected prosperity does for usso it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow The service was very simple and very solemn There were only ourselves and the servants there one or two old friends of his from Exeter his London agent and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton the President of the Incorporated Law Society Jonathan and I stood hand in hand and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us We came back to town quietly taking a bus to Hyde Park Corner Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while so we sat down but there were very few people there and it was sadlooking and desolate to see so many empty chairs It made us think of the empty chair at home so we got up and walked down Piccadilly Jonathan was holding me by the arm the way he used to in old days before I went to school I felt it very improper for you cant go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit but it was Jonathan and he was my husband and we didnt know anybody who saw usand we didnt care if they didso on we walked I was looking at a very beautiful girl in a big cartwheel hat sitting in a victoria outside Guilianos when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me and he said under his breath My God I am always anxious about Jonathan for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again so I turned to him quickly and asked him what it was that disturbed him He was very pale and his eyes seemed bulging out as half in terror and half in amazement he gazed at a tall thin man with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard who was also observing the pretty girl He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us and so I had a good view of him His face was not a good face it was hard and cruel and sensual and his big white teeth that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red were pointed like an animals Jonathan kept staring at him till I was afraid he would notice I feared he might take it ill he looked so fierce and nasty I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed and he answered evidently thinking that I knew as much about it as he did Do you see who it is No dear I said I dont know him who is it His answer seemed to shock and thrill me for it was said as if he did not know that it was to me Mina to whom he was speaking It is the man himself The poor dear was evidently terrified at somethingvery greatly terrified I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down He kept staring a man came out of the shop with a small parcel and gave it to the lady who then drove off The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her and when the carriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction and hailed a hansom Jonathan kept looking after him and said as if to himself I believe it is the Count but he has grown young My God if this be so Oh my God my God If I only knew if I only knew He was distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions so I remained silent I drew him away quietly and he holding my arm came easily We walked a little further and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park It was a hot day for autumn and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place After a few minutes staring at nothing Jonathans eyes closed and he went quietly into a sleep with his head on my shoulder I thought it was the best thing for him so did not disturb him In about twenty minutes he woke up and said to me quite cheerfully Why Mina have I been asleep Oh do forgive me for being so rude Come and well have a cup of tea somewhere He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of I dont like this lapsing into forgetfulness it may make or continue some injury to the brain I must not ask him for fear I shall do more harm than good but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad The time is come I fear when I must open that parcel and know what is written Oh Jonathan you will I know forgive me if I do wrong but it is for your own dear sake      LaterA sad homecoming in every waythe house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady and now a telegram from Van Helsing whoever he may be You will be grieved to hear that Mrs Westenra died five days ago and that Lucy died the day before yesterday They were both buried today Oh what a wealth of sorrow in a few words Poor Mrs Westenra poor Lucy Gone gone never to return to us And poor poor Arthur to have lost such sweetness out of his life God help us all to bear our troubles Dr Sewards Diary 22 SeptemberIt is all over Arthur has gone back to Ring and has taken Quincey Morris with him What a fine fellow is Quincey I believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucys death as any of us but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking If America can go on breeding men like that she will be a power in the world indeed Van Helsing is lying down having a rest preparatory to his journey He goes over to Amsterdam tonight but says he returns tomorrow night that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally He is to stop with me then if he can he says he has work to do in London which may take him some time Poor old fellow I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength All the time of the burial he was I could see putting some terrible restraint on himself When it was all over we were standing beside Arthur who poor fellow was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucys veins I could see Van Helsings face grow white and purple by turns Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of God None of us said a word of the other operations and none of us ever shall Arthur and Quincey went away together to the station and Van Helsing and I came on here The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics He has denied to me since that it was hysterics and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions He laughed till he cried and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge and then he cried till he laughed again and laughed and cried together just as a woman does I tried to be stern with him as one is to a woman under the circumstances but it had no effect Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness Then when his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth and why at such a time His reply was in a way characteristic of him for it was logical and forceful and mysterious He said Ah you dont comprehend friend John Do not think that I am not sad though I laugh See I have cried even when the laugh did choke me But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry for the laugh he come just the same Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say May I come in is not the true laughter No he is a king and he come when and how he like He ask no person he choose no time of suitability He say I am here Behold in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl I give my blood for her though I am old and worn I give my time my skill my sleep I let my other sufferers want that so she may have all And yet I can laugh at her very gravelaugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say Thud thud to my heart till it send back the blood from my cheek My heart bleed for that poor boythat dear boy so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live and with his hair and eyes the same There you know now why I love him so And yet when he say things that touch my husbandheart to the quick and make my fatherheart yearn to him as to no other mannot even to you friend John for we are more level in experiences than father and sonyet even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear Here I am here I am till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek Oh friend John it is a strange world a sad world a world full of miseries and woes and troubles and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play Bleeding hearts and dry bones of the churchyard and tears that burn as they fallall dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him And believe me friend John that he is good to come and kind Ah we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways Then tears come and like the rain on the ropes they brace us up until perhaps the strain become too great and we break But King Laugh he come like the sunshine and he ease off the strain again and we bear to go on with our labour what it may be I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea but as I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter I asked him As he answered me his face grew stern and he said in quite a different tone Oh it was the grim irony of it allthis so lovely lady garlanded with flowers that looked so fair as life till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard where rest so many of her kin laid there with the mother who loved her and whom she loved and that sacred bell going Toll toll toll so sad and slow and those holy men with the white garments of the angel pretending to read books and yet all the time their eyes never on the page and all of us with the bowed head And all for what She is dead so Is it not Well for the life of me Professor I said I cant see anything to laugh at in all that Why your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before But even if the burial service was comic what about poor Art and his trouble Why his heart was simply breaking Just so Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride Yes and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him Quite so But there was a difficulty friend John If so that then what about the others Ho ho Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist and me with my poor wife dead to me but alive by Churchs law though no wits all goneeven I who am faithful husband to this nownowife am bigamist I dont see where the joke comes in there either I said and I did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things He laid his hand on my arm and said Friend John forgive me if I pain I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound but only to you my old friend whom I can trust If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh if you could have done so when the laugh arrived if you could do so now when King Laugh have pack up his crown and all that is to himfor he go far far away from me and for a long long timemaybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all I was touched by the tenderness of his tone and asked why Because I know And now we are all scattered and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings Lucy lies in the tomb of her kin a lordly deathhouse in a lonely churchyard away from teeming London where the air is fresh and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill and where wild flowers grow of their own accord So I can finish this diary and God only knows if I shall ever begin another If I do or if I even open this again it will be to deal with different people and different themes for here at the end where the romance of my life is told ere I go back to take up the thread of my lifework I say sadly and without hope FINIS The Westminster Gazette 25 September A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as The Kensington Horror or The Stabbing Woman or The Woman in Black During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a bloofer lady It has always been late in the evening when they have been missed and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning It is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a bloofer lady had asked him to come for a walk the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the bloofer lady is supremely funny Some of our caricaturists might he says take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture It is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the bloofer lady should be the popular rle at these al fresco performances Our correspondent navely says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubbyfaced little children pretendand even imagine themselvesto be There is however possibly a serious side to the question for some of the children indeed all who have been missed at night have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog and although of not much importance individually would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying children especially when very young in and around Hampstead Heath and for any stray dog which may be about The Westminster Gazette 25 September Extra Special THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR ANOTHER CHILD INJURED The Bloofer Lady We have just received intelligence that another child missed last night was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the Shooters Hill side of Hampstead Heath which is perhaps less frequented than the other parts It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases It was terribly weak and looked quite emaciated It too when partially restored had the common story to tell of being lured away by the bloofer lady CHAPTER XIV MINA HARKERS JOURNAL 23 SeptemberJonathan is better after a bad night I am so glad that he has plenty of work to do for that keeps his mind off the terrible things and oh I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position I knew he would be true to himself and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him He will be away all day till late for he said he could not lunch at home My household work is done so I shall take his foreign journal and lock myself up in my room and read it 24 SeptemberI hadnt the heart to write last night that terrible record of Jonathans upset me so Poor dear How he must have suffered whether it be true or only imagination I wonder if there is any truth in it at all Did he get his brain fever and then write all those terrible things or had he some cause for it all I suppose I shall never know for I dare not open the subject to him And yet that man we saw yesterday He seemed quite certain of him Poor fellow I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought He believes it all himself I remember how on our weddingday he said Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awake mad or sane There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity That fearful Count was coming to London If it should be and he came to London with his teeming millions There may be a solemn duty and if it come we must not shrink from it I shall be prepared I shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing Then we shall be ready for other eyes if required And if it be wanted then perhaps if I am ready poor Jonathan may not be upset for I can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all and I can ask him questions and find out things and see how I may comfort him Letter Van Helsing to Mrs Harker 24 September Confidence Dear Madam I pray you to pardon my writing in that I am so far friend as that I sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenras death By the kindness of Lord Godalming I am empowered to read her letters and papers for I am deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important In them I find some letters from you which show how great friends you were and how you love her Oh Madam Mina by that love I implore you help me It is for others good that I askto redress great wrong and to lift much and terrible troublesthat may be more great than you can know May it be that I see you You can trust me I am friend of Dr John Seward and of Lord Godalming that was Arthur of Miss Lucy I must keep it private for the present from all I should come to Exeter to see you at once if you tell me I am privilege to come and where and when I implore your pardon madam I have read your letters to poor Lucy and know how good you are and how your husband suffer so I pray you if it may be enlighten him not lest it may harm Again your pardon and forgive me VAN HELSING Telegram Mrs Harker to Van Helsing 25 SeptemberCome today by quarterpast ten train if you can catch it Can see you any time you call WILHELMINA HARKER MINA HARKERS JOURNAL 25 SeptemberI cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of Dr Van Helsing for somehow I expect that it will throw some light upon Jonathans sad experience and as he attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness he can tell me all about her That is the reason of his coming it is concerning Lucy and her sleepwalking and not about Jonathan Then I shall never know the real truth now How silly I am That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour Of course it is about Lucy That habit came back to the poor dear and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards She must have told him of her sleepwalking adventure on the cliff and that I knew all about it and now he wants me to tell him what she knows so that he may understand I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs Westenra I should never forgive myself if any act of mine were it even a negative one brought harm on poor dear Lucy I hope too Dr Van Helsing will not blame me I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present I suppose a cry does us all good at timesclears the air as other rain does Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me and then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night the first time we have been parted since our marriage I do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself and that nothing will occur to upset him It is two oclock and the doctor will be here soon now I shall say nothing of Jonathans journal unless he asks me I am so glad I have typewritten out my own journal so that in case he asks about Lucy I can hand it to him it will save much questioning      LaterHe has come and gone Oh what a strange meeting and how it all makes my head whirl round I feel like one in a dream Can it be all possible or even a part of it If I had not read Jonathans journal first I should never have accepted even a possibility Poor poor dear Jonathan How he must have suffered Please the good God all this may not upset him again I shall try to save him from it but it may be even a consolation and a help to himterrible though it be and awful in its consequencesto know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him and that it is all true It may be that it is the doubt which haunts him that when the doubt is removed no matter whichwaking or dreamingmay prove the truth he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock Dr Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthurs friend and Dr Sewards and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy I feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature When he comes tomorrow I shall ask him about Jonathan and then please God all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end I used to think I would like to practise interviewing Jonathans friend on The Exeter News told him that memory was everything in such workthat you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken even if you had to refine some of it afterwards Here was a rare interview I shall try to record it verbatim It was halfpast two oclock when the knock came I took my courage  deux mains and waited In a few minutes Mary opened the door and announced Dr Van Helsing I rose and bowed and he came towards me a man of medium weight strongly built with his shoulders set back over a broad deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck The poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power the head is noble wellsized broad and large behind the ears The face cleanshaven shows a hard square chin a large resolute mobile mouth a goodsized nose rather straight but with quick sensitive nostrils that seem to broaden as the big bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens The forehead is broad and fine rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it but falls naturally back and to the sides Big dark blue eyes are set widely apart and are quick and tender or stern with the mans moods He said to me Mrs Harker is it not I bowed assent That was Miss Mina Murray Again I assented It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear child Lucy Westenra Madam Mina it is on account of the dead I come Sir I said you could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra And I held out my hand He took it and said tenderly Oh Madam Mina I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good but I had yet to learn He finished his speech with a courtly bow I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about so he at once began I have read your letters to Miss Lucy Forgive me but I had to begin to inquire somewhere and there was none to ask I know that you were with her at Whitby She sometimes kept a diaryyou need not look surprised Madam Mina it was begun after you had left and was in imitation of youand in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleepwalking in which she puts down that you saved her In great perplexity then I come to you and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember I can tell you I think Dr Van Helsing all about it Ah then you have good memory for facts for details It is not always so with young ladies No doctor but I wrote it all down at the time I can show it to you if you like Oh Madam Mina I will be grateful you will do me much favour I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bitI suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouthsso I handed him the shorthand diary He took it with a grateful bow and said May I read it If you wish I answered as demurely as I could He opened it and for an instant his face fell Then he stood up and bowed Oh you so clever woman he said I knew long that Mr Jonathan was a man of much thankfulness but see his wife have all the good things And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me Alas I know not the shorthand By this time my little joke was over and I was almost ashamed so I took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him Forgive me I said I could not help it but I had been thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask and so that you might not have time to waitnot on my account but because I know your time must be preciousI have written it out on the typewriter for you He took it and his eyes glistened You are so good he said And may I read it now I may want to ask you some things when I have read By all means I said read it over whilst I order lunch and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light and became absorbed in the papers whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed When I came back I found him walking hurriedly up and down the room his face all ablaze with excitement He rushed up to me and took me by both hands Oh Madam Mina he said how can I say what I owe to you This paper is as sunshine It opens the gate to me I am daze I am dazzle with so much light and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time But that you do not cannot comprehend Oh but I am grateful to you you so clever woman Madamhe said this very solemnlyif ever Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours I trust you will let me know It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend as a friend but all I have ever learned all I can ever do shall be for you and those you love There are darknesses in life and there are lights you are one of the lights You will have happy life and good life and your husband will be blessed in you But doctor you praise me too much andand you do not know me Not know youI who am old and who have studied all my life men and women I who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him And I have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me and which breathes out truth in every line I who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust not know you Oh Madam Mina good women tell all their lives and by day and by hour and by minute such things that angels can read and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels eyes Your husband is noble nature and you are noble too for you trust and trust cannot be where there is mean nature And your husbandtell me of him Is he quite well Is all that fever gone and is he strong and hearty I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan so I said He was almost recovered but he has been greatly upset by Mr Hawkinss death He interrupted Oh yes I know I know I have read your last two letters I went on I suppose this upset him for when we were in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock A shock and after brain fever so soon That was not good What kind of a shock was it He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible something which led to his brain fever And here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush The pity for Jonathan the horror which he experienced the whole fearful mystery of his diary and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since all came in a tumult I suppose I was hysterical for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him and implored him to make my husband well again He took my hands and raised me up and made me sit on the sofa and sat by me he held my hand in his and said to me with oh such infinite sweetness My life is a barren and lonely one and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendships but since I have been summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel more than everand it has grown with my advancing yearsthe loneliness of my life Believe me then that I come here full of respect for you and you have given me hopehope not in what I am seeking of but that there are good women still left to make life happygood women whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be I am glad glad that I may here be of some use to you for if your husband suffer he suffer within the range of my study and experience I promise you that I will gladly do all for him that I canall to make his life strong and manly and your life a happy one Now you must eat You are overwrought and perhaps overanxious Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale and what he like not where he love is not to his good Therefore for his sake you must eat and smile You have told me all about Lucy and so now we shall not speak of it lest it distress I shall stay in Exeter tonight for I want to think much over what you have told me and when I have thought I will ask you questions if I may And then too you will tell me of husband Jonathans trouble so far as you can but not yet You must eat now afterwards you shall tell me all After lunch when we went back to the drawingroom he said to me And now tell me all about him When it came to speaking to this great learned man I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool and Jonathan a madmanthat journal is all so strangeand I hesitated to go on But he was so sweet and kind and he had promised to help and I trusted him so I said Dr Van Helsing what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband I have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt you must be kind to me and not think me foolish that I have even half believed some very strange things He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said Oh my dear if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I am here it is you who would laugh I have learned not to think little of any ones belief no matter how strange it be I have tried to keep an open mind and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it but the strange things the extraordinary things the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane Thank you thank you a thousand times You have taken a weight off my mind If you will let me I shall give you a paper to read It is long but I have typewritten it out It will tell you my trouble and Jonathans It is the copy of his journal when abroad and all that happened I dare not say anything of it you will read for yourself and judge And then when I see you perhaps you will be very kind and tell me what you think I promise he said as I gave him the papers I shall in the morning so soon as I can come to see you and your husband if I may Jonathan will be here at halfpast eleven and you must come to lunch with us and see him then you could catch the quick 334 train which will leave you at Paddington before eight He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains offhand but he does not know that I have made up all the trains to and from Exeter so that I may help Jonathan in case he is in a hurry So he took the papers with him and went away and I sit here thinkingthinking I dont know what      Letter by hand Van Helsing to Mrs Harker 25 September 6 oclock Dear Madam Mina I have read your husbands so wonderful diary You may sleep without doubt Strange and terrible as it is it is true I will pledge my life on it It may be worse for others but for him and you there is no dread He is a noble fellow and let me tell you from experience of men that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that roomay and going a second timeis not one to be injured in permanence by a shock His brain and his heart are all right this I swear before I have even seen him so be at rest I shall have much to ask him of other things I am blessed that today I come to see you for I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzledazzle more than ever and I must think Yours the most faithful ABRAHAM VAN HELSING Letter Mrs Harker to Van Helsing 25 September 630 p m My dear Dr Van Helsing A thousand thanks for your kind letter which has taken a great weight off my mind And yet if it be true what terrible things there are in the world and what an awful thing if that man that monster be really in London I fear to think I have this moment whilst writing had a wire from Jonathan saying that he leaves by the 625 tonight from Launceston and will be here at 1018 so that I shall have no fear tonight Will you therefore instead of lunching with us please come to breakfast at eight oclock if this be not too early for you You can get away if you are in a hurry by the 1030 train which will bring you to Paddington by 235 Do not answer this as I shall take it that if I do not hear you will come to breakfast Believe me Your faithful and grateful friend MINA HARKER Jonathan Harkers Journal 26 SeptemberI thought never to write in this diary again but the time has come When I got home last night Mina had supper ready and when we had supped she told me of Van Helsings visit and of her having given him the two diaries copied out and of how anxious she has been about me She showed me in the doctors letter that all I wrote down was true It seems to have made a new man of me It was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over I felt impotent and in the dark and distrustful But now that I know I am not afraid even of the Count He has succeeded after all then in his design in getting to London and it was he I saw He has got younger and how Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out if he is anything like what Mina says We sat late and talked it all over Mina is dressing and I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over He was I think surprised to see me When I came into the room where he was and introduced myself he took me by the shoulder and turned my face round to the light and said after a sharp scrutiny But Madam Mina told me you were ill that you had had a shock It was so funny to hear my wife called Madam Mina by this kindly strongfaced old man I smiled and said I was ill I have had a shock but you have cured me already And how By your letter to Mina last night I was in doubt and then everything took a hue of unreality and I did not know what to trust even the evidence of my own senses Not knowing what to trust I did not know what to do and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life The groove ceased to avail me and I mistrusted myself Doctor you dont know what it is to doubt everything even yourself No you dont you couldnt with eyebrows like yours He seemed pleased and laughed as he said So You are physiognomist I learn more here with each hour I am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast and oh sir you will pardon praise from an old man but you are blessed in your wife I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day so I simply nodded and stood silent She is one of Gods women fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter and that its light can be here on earth So true so sweet so noble so little an egoistand that let me tell you is much in this age so sceptical and selfish And you sirI have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy and some of them speak of you so I know you since some days from the knowing of others but I have seen your true self since last night You will give me your hand will you not And let us be friends for all our lives We shook hands and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite choky And now he said may I ask you for some more help I have a great task to do and at the beginning it is to know You can help me here Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania Later on I may ask more help and of a different kind but at first this will do Look here sir I said does what you have to do concern the Count It does he said solemnly Then I am with you heart and soul As you go by the 1030 train you will not have time to read them but I shall get the bundle of papers You can take them with you and read them in the train After breakfast I saw him to the station When we were parting he said Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you and take Madam Mina too We shall both come when you will I said I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous night and while we were talking at the carriage window waiting for the train to start he was turning them over His eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them The Westminster GazetteI knew it by the colourand he grew quite white He read something intently groaning to himself Mein Gott Mein Gott So soon so soon I do not think he remembered me at the moment Just then the whistle blew and the train moved off This recalled him to himself and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand calling out Love to Madam Mina I shall write so soon as ever I can Dr Sewards Diary 26 SeptemberTruly there is no such thing as finality Not a week since I said Finis and yet here I am starting fresh again or rather going on with the same record Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done Renfield had become to all intents as sane as he ever was He was already well ahead with his fly business and he had just started in the spider line also so he had not been of any trouble to me I had a letter from Arthur written on Sunday and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well Quincey Morris is with him and that is much of a help for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits Quincey wrote me a line too and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy so as to them all my mind is at rest As for myself I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised Everything is however now reopened and what is to be the end God only knows I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows too but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity He went to Exeter yesterday and stayed there all night Today he came back and almost bounded into the room at about halfpast five oclock and thrust last nights Westminster Gazette into my hand What do you think of that he asked as he stood back and folded his arms I looked over the paper for I really did not know what he meant but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at Hampstead It did not convey much to me until I reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats An idea struck me and I looked up Well he said It is like poor Lucys And what do you make of it Simply that there is some cause in common Whatever it was that injured her has injured them I did not quite understand his answer That is true indirectly but not directly How do you mean Professor I asked I was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightlyfor after all four days of rest and freedom from burning harrowing anxiety does help to restore ones spiritsbut when I saw his face it sobered me Never even in the midst of our despair about poor Lucy had he looked more stern Tell me I said I can hazard no opinion I do not know what to think and I have no data on which to found a conjecture Do you mean to tell me friend John that you have no suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of not after all the hints given not only by events but by me Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood And how the blood lost or waste I shook my head He stepped over and sat down beside me and went on You are clever man friend John you reason well and your wit is bold but you are too prejudiced You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand and yet which are that some people see things that others cannot But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by mens eyes because they knowor think they knowsome things which other men have told them Ah it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all and if it explain not then it says there is nothing to explain But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs which think themselves new and which are yet but the old which pretend to be younglike the fine ladies at the opera I suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference No Nor in materialisation No Nor in astral bodies No Nor in the reading of thought No Nor in hypnotism Yes I said Charcot has proved that pretty well He smiled as he went on Then you are satisfied as to it Yes And of course then you understand how it act and can follow the mind of the great Charcotalas that he is no moreinto the very soul of the patient that he influence No Then friend John am I to take it that you simply accept fact and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank No Then tell mefor I am student of the brainhow you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading Let me tell you my friend that there are things done today in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricitywho would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards There are always mysteries in life Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred years and Old Parr one hundred and sixtynine and yet that poor Lucy with four mens blood in her poor veins could not live even one day For had she live one more day we could have save her Do you know all the mystery of life and death Do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men and not in others Can you tell me why when other spiders die small and soon that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew till on descending he could drink the oil of all the church lamps Can you tell me why in the Pampas ay and elsewhere there are bats that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods and that when the sailors sleep on the deck because that it is hot flit down on them and thenand then in the morning are found dead men white as even Miss Lucy was Good God Professor I said starting up Do you mean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat and that such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century He waved his hand for silence and went on Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are some few who live on always if they be permit that there are men and women who cannot die We all knowbecause science has vouched for the factthat there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir not dead but that rise up and walk amongst them as before Here I interrupted him I was getting bewildered he so crowded on my mind his list of natures eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam but he used then to tell me the thing so that I could have the object of thought in mind all the time But now I was without this help yet I wanted to follow him so I said Professor let me be your pet student again Tell me the thesis so that I may apply your knowledge as you go on At present I am going in my mind from point to point as a mad man and not a sane one follows an idea I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where I am going That is good image he said Well I shall tell you My thesis is this I want you to believe To believe what To believe in things that you cannot Let me illustrate I heard once of an American who so defined faith that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue For one I follow that man He meant that we shall have an open mind and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth like a small rock does a railway truck We get the small truth first Good We keep him and we value him but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter Do I read your lesson aright Ah you are my favourite pupil still It is worth to teach you Now that you are willing to understand you have taken the first step to understand You think then that those so small holes in the childrens throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy I suppose so He stood up and said solemnly Then you are wrong Oh would it were so but alas no It is worse far far worse In Gods name Professor Van Helsing what do you mean I cried He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair and placed his elbows on the table covering his face with his hands as he spoke They were made by Miss Lucy CHAPTER XV DR SEWARDS DIARYcontinued For a while sheer anger mastered me it was as if he had during her life struck Lucy on the face I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to him Dr Van Helsing are you mad He raised his head and looked at me and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once Would I were he said Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this Oh my friend why think you did I go so far round why take so long to tell you so simple a thing Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life Was it because I wished to give you pain Was it that I wanted now so late revenge for that time when you saved my life and from a fearful death Ah no Forgive me said I He went on My friend it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you for I know you have loved that so sweet lady But even yet I do not expect you to believe It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the no of it it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth and of such a one as Miss Lucy Tonight I go to prove it Dare you come with me This staggered me A man does not like to prove such a truth Byron excepted from the category jealousy And prove the very truth he most abhorred He saw my hesitation and spoke The logic is simple no madmans logic this time jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog If it be not true then proof will be relief at worst it will not harm If it be true Ah there is the dread yet very dread should help my cause for in it is some need of belief Come I tell you what I propose first that we go off now and see that child in the hospital Dr Vincent of the North Hospital where the papers say the child is is friend of mine and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam He will let two scientists see his case if he will not let two friends We shall tell him nothing but only that we wish to learn And then And then He took a key from his pocket and held it up And then we spend the night you and I in the churchyard where Lucy lies This is the key that lock the tomb I had it from the coffinman to give to Arthur My heart sank within me for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us I could do nothing however so I plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten as the afternoon was passing We found the child awake It had had a sleep and taken some food and altogether was going on well Dr Vincent took the bandage from its throat and showed us the punctures There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucys throat They were smaller and the edges looked fresher that was all We asked Vincent to what he attributed them and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal perhaps a rat but for his own part he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London Out of so many harmless ones he said there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species Some sailor may have brought one home and it managed to escape or even from the Zological Gardens a young one may have got loose or one be bred there from a vampire These things do occur you know Only ten days ago a wolf got out and was I believe traced up in this direction For a week after the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this bloofer lady scare came along since when it has been quite a galatime with them Even this poor little mite when he woke up today asked the nurse if he might go away When she asked him why he wanted to go he said he wanted to play with the bloofer lady I hope said Van Helsing that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it These fancies to stray are most dangerous and if the child were to remain out another night it would probably be fatal But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days Certainly not not for a week at least longer if the wound is not healed Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on and the sun had dipped before we came out When Van Helsing saw how dark it was he said There is no hurry It is more late than I thought Come let us seek somewhere that we may eat and then we shall go on our way We dined at Jack Straws Castle along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy About ten oclock we started from the inn It was then very dark and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go for he went on unhesitatingly but as for me I was in quite a mixup as to locality As we went further we met fewer and fewer people till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round At last we reached the wall of the churchyard which we climbed over With some little difficultyfor it was very dark and the whole place seemed so strange to uswe found the Westenra tomb The Professor took the key opened the creaky door and standing back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me to precede him There was a delicious irony in the offer in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion My companion followed me quickly and cautiously drew the door to after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling and not a spring one In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight Then he fumbled in his bag and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle proceeded to make a light The tomb in the daytime and when wreathed with fresh flowers had looked grim and gruesome enough but now some days afterwards when the flowers hung lank and dead their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance when timediscoloured stone and dustencrusted mortar and rusty dank iron and tarnished brass and clouded silverplating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined It conveyed irresistibly the idea that lifeanimal lifewas not the only thing which could pass away Van Helsing went about his work systematically Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal he made assurance of Lucys coffin Another search in his bag and he took out a turnscrew What are you going to do I asked To open the coffin You shall yet be convinced Straightway he began taking out the screws and finally lifted off the lid showing the casing of lead beneath The sight was almost too much for me It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living I actually took hold of his hand to stop him He only said You shall see and again fumbling in his bag took out a tiny fretsaw Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab which made me wince he made a small hole which was however big enough to admit the point of the saw I had expected a rush of gas from the weekold corpse We doctors who have had to study our dangers have to become accustomed to such things and I drew back towards the door But the Professor never stopped for a moment he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin and then across and down the other side Taking the edge of the loose flange he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin and holding up the candle into the aperture motioned to me to look I drew near and looked The coffin was empty It was certainly a surprise to me and gave me a considerable shock but Van Helsing was unmoved He was now more sure than ever of his ground and so emboldened to proceed in his task Are you satisfied now friend John he asked I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him I am satisfied that Lucys body is not in that coffin but that only proves one thing And what is that friend John That it is not there That is good logic he said so far as it goes But how do youhow can youaccount for it not being there Perhaps a bodysnatcher I suggested Some of the undertakers people may have stolen it I felt that I was speaking folly and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest The Professor sighed Ah well he said we must have more proof Come with me He put on the coffinlid again gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag blew out the light and placed the candle also in the bag We opened the door and went out Behind us he closed the door and locked it He handed me the key saying Will you keep it You had better be assured I laughedit was not a very cheerful laugh I am bound to sayas I motioned him to keep it A key is nothing I said there may be duplicates and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind He said nothing but put the key in his pocket Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other I took up my place behind a yewtree and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight It was a lonely vigil Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve and in time came one and two I was chilled and unnerved and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had a dreary miserable time Suddenly as I turned round I thought I saw something like a white streak moving between two dark yewtrees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb at the same time a dark mass moved from the Professors side of the ground and hurriedly went towards it Then I too moved but I had to go round headstones and railedoff tombs and I stumbled over graves The sky was overcast and somewhere far off an early cock crew A little way off beyond a line of scattered junipertrees which marked the pathway to the church a white dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb The tomb itself was hidden by trees and I could not see where the figure disappeared I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure and coming over found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child When he saw me he held it out to me and said Are you satisfied now No I said in a way that I felt was aggressive Do you not see the child Yes it is a child but who brought it here And is it wounded I asked We shall see said the Professor and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard he carrying the sleeping child When we had got some little distance away we went into a clump of trees and struck a match and looked at the childs throat It was without a scratch or scar of any kind Was I right I asked triumphantly We were just in time said the Professor thankfully We had now to decide what we were to do with the child and so consulted about it If we were to take it to a policestation we should have to give some account of our movements during the night at least we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath and when we heard a policeman coming would leave it where he could not fail to find it we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could All fell out well At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policemans heavy tramp and laying the child on the pathway we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro We heard his exclamation of astonishment and then we went away silently By good chance we got a cab near the Spaniards and drove to town I cannot sleep so I make this entry But I must try to get a few hours sleep as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon He insists that I shall go with him on another expedition      27 SeptemberIt was two oclock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt The funeral held at noon was all completed and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away when looking carefully from behind a clump of aldertrees we saw the sexton lock the gate after him We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work Besides I felt it was all so useless Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again when we knew from the evidence of our own eyesight that the coffin was empty I shrugged my shoulders however and rested silent for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road no matter who remonstrated He took the key opened the vault and again courteously motioned me to precede The place was not so gruesome as last night but oh how unutterably meanlooking when the sunshine streamed in Van Helsing walked over to Lucys coffin and I followed He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me There lay Lucy seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral She was if possible more radiantly beautiful than ever and I could not believe that she was dead The lips were red nay redder than before and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom Is this a juggle I said to him Are you convinced now said the Professor in response and as he spoke he put over his hand and in a way that made me shudder pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth See he went on see they are even sharper than before With this and thisand he touched one of the canine teeth and that below itthe little children can be bitten Are you of belief now friend John Once more argumentative hostility woke within me I could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested so with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed I said She may have been placed here since last night Indeed That is so and by whom I do not know Some one has done it And yet she has been dead one week Most peoples in that time would not look so I had no answer for this so was silent Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence at any rate he showed neither chagrin nor triumph He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth Then he turned to me and said Here there is one thing which is different from all recorded here is some dual life that is not as the common She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance sleepwalkingoh you start you do not know that friend John but you shall know it all laterand in trance could he best come to take more blood In trance she died and in trance she is UnDead too So it is that she differ from all other Usually when the UnDead sleep at homeas he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was hometheir face show what they are but this so sweet that was when she not UnDead she go back to the nothings of the common dead There is no malign there see and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep This turned my blood cold and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsings theories but if she were really dead what was there of terror in the idea of killing her He looked up at me and evidently saw the change in my face for he said almost joyously Ah you believe now I answered Do not press me too hard all at once I am willing to accept How will you do this bloody work I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic and I shall drive a stake through her body It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected I was in fact beginning to shudder at the presence of this being this UnDead as Van Helsing called it and to loathe it Is it possible that love is all subjective or all objective I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin but he stood as if wrapped in thought Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap and said I have been thinking and have made up my mind as to what is best If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now at this moment what is to be done but there are other things to follow and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know This is simple She have yet no life taken though that is of time and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever But then we may have to want Arthur and how shall we tell him of this If you who saw the wounds on Lucys throat and saw the wounds so similar on the childs at the hospital if you who saw the coffin empty last night and full today with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week after she dieif you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard and yet of your own senses you did not believe how then can I expect Arthur who know none of those things to believe He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say goodbye as he ought and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive and that in most mistake of all we have killed her He will then argue back that it is we mistaken ones that have killed her by our ideas and so he will be much unhappy always Yet he never can be sure and that is the worst of all And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered and again he will think that we may be right and that his so beloved was after all an UnDead No I told him once and since then I learn much Now since I know it is all true a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet He poor fellow must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him then we can act for good all round and send him peace My mind is made up Let us go You return home for tonight to your asylum and see that all be well As for me I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way Tomorrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock I shall send for Arthur to come too and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood Later we shall all have work to do I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine for I must be back here before the sun set So we locked the tomb and came away and got over the wall of the churchyard which was not much of a task and drove back to Piccadilly Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau Berkeley Hotel directed to John Seward M D Not delivered 27 September Friend John I write this in case anything should happen I go alone to watch in that churchyard It pleases me that the UnDead Miss Lucy shall not leave tonight that so on the morrow night she may be more eager Therefore I shall fix some things she like notgarlic and a crucifixand so seal up the door of the tomb She is young as UnDead and will heed Moreover these are only to prevent her coming out they may not prevail on her wanting to get in for then the UnDead is desperate and must find the line of least resistance whatsoever it may be I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it For Miss Lucy or from her I have no fear but that other to whom is there that she is UnDead he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter He is cunning as I know from Mr Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucys life and we lost and in many ways the UnDead are strong He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him Besides he can summon his wolf and I know not what So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me but none other shalluntil it be too late But it may be that he will not attempt the place There is no reason why he should his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the UnDead woman sleep and the one old man watch Therefore I write this in case Take the papers that are with this the diaries of Harker and the rest and read them and then find this great UnDead and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it so that the world may rest from him If it be so farewell VAN HELSING Dr Sewards Diary 28 SeptemberIt is wonderful what a good nights sleep will do for one Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsings monstrous ideas but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense I have no doubt that he believes it all I wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged Surely there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself He is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way I am loath to think it and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van Helsing was mad but anyhow I shall watch him carefully I may get some light on the mystery      29 September morning Last night at a little before ten oclock Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsings room he told us all that he wanted us to do but especially addressing himself to Arthur as if all our wills were centred in his He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too for he said there is a grave duty to be done there You were doubtless surprised at my letter This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming I was It rather upset me for a bit There has been so much trouble around my house of late that I could do without any more I have been curious too as to what you mean Quincey and I talked it over but the more we talked the more puzzled we got till now I can say for myself that Im about up a tree as to any meaning about anything Me too said Quincey Morris laconically Oh said the Professor then you are nearer the beginning both of you than friend John here who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word Then turning to the other two he said with intense gravity I want your permission to do what I think good this night It is I know much to ask and when you know what it is I propose to do you will know and only then how much Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark so that afterwards though you may be angry with me for a timeI must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may beyou shall not blame yourselves for anything Thats frank anyhow broke in Quincey Ill answer for the Professor I dont quite see his drift but I swear hes honest and thats good enough for me I thank you sir said Van Helsing proudly I have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend and such endorsement is dear to me He held out a hand which Quincey took Then Arthur spoke out Dr Van Helsing I dont quite like to buy a pig in a poke as they say in Scotland and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned I cannot make such a promise If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two then I give my consent at once though for the life of me I cannot understand what you are driving at I accept your limitation said Van Helsing and all I ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations Agreed said Arthur that is only fair And now that the pourparlers are over may I ask what it is we are to do I want you to come with me and to come in secret to the churchyard at Kingstead Arthurs face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way Where poor Lucy is buried The Professor bowed Arthur went on And when there To enter the tomb Arthur stood up Professor are you in earnest or it is some monstrous joke Pardon me I see that you are in earnest He sat down again but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly as one who is on his dignity There was silence until he asked again And when in the tomb To open the coffin This is too much he said angrily rising again I am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable but in thisthis desecration of the graveof one who He fairly choked with indignation The Professor looked pityingly at him If I could spare you one pang my poor friend he said God knows I would But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths or later and for ever the feet you love must walk in paths of flame Arthur looked up with set white face and said Take care sir take care Would it not be well to hear what I have to say said Van Helsing And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose Shall I go on Thats fair enough broke in Morris After a pause Van Helsing went on evidently with an effort Miss Lucy is dead is it not so Yes Then there can be no wrong to her But if she be not dead Arthur jumped to his feet Good God he cried What do you mean Has there been any mistake has she been buried alive He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften I did not say she was alive my child I did not think it I go no further than to say that she might be UnDead UnDead Not alive What do you mean Is this all a nightmare or what is it There are mysteries which men can only guess at which age by age they may solve only in part Believe me we are now on the verge of one But I have not done May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy Heavens and earth no cried Arthur in a storm of passion Not for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body Dr Van Helsing you try me too far What have I done to you that you should torture me so What did that poor sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave Are you mad to speak such things or am I mad to listen to them Dont dare to think more of such a desecration I shall not give my consent to anything you do I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage and by God I shall do it Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated and said gravely and sternly My Lord Godalming I too have a duty to do a duty to others a duty to you a duty to the dead and by God I shall do it All I ask you now is that you come with me that you look and listen and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than I am thenthen I shall do my duty whatever it may seem to me And then to follow of your Lordships wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you when and where you will His voice broke a little and he went on with a voice full of pity But I beseech you do not go forth in anger with me In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do and which sometimes did wring my heart I have never had so heavy a task as now Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow Just think For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good at the first to please my friend John and then to help a sweet young lady whom too I came to love For herI am ashamed to say so much but I say it in kindnessI gave what you gave the blood of my veins I gave it I who was not like you her lover but only her physician and her friend I gave to her my nights and daysbefore death after death and if my death can do her good even now when she is the dead UnDead she shall have it freely He said this with a very grave sweet pride and Arthur was much affected by it He took the old mans hand and said in a broken voice Oh it is hard to think of it and I cannot understand but at least I shall go with you and wait CHAPTER XVI DR SEWARDS DIARYcontinued It was just a quarter before twelve oclock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky We all kept somehow close together with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him but he bore himself well I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief The Professor unlocked the door and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons solved the difficulty by entering first himself The rest of us followed and he closed the door He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly Van Helsing said to me You were with me here yesterday Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin It was The Professor turned to the rest saying You hear and yet there is no one who does not believe with me He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin Arthur looked on very pale but silent when the lid was removed he stepped forward He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin or at any rate had not thought of it When he saw the rent in the lead the blood rushed to his face for an instant but as quickly fell away again so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness he was still silent Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange and we all looked in and recoiled The coffin was empty For several minutes no one spoke a word The silence was broken by Quincey Morris Professor I answered for you Your word is all I want I wouldnt ask such a thing ordinarilyI wouldnt so dishonour you as to imply a doubt but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour Is this your doing I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor touched her What happened was this Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came herewith good purpose believe me I opened that coffin which was then sealed up and we found it as now empty We then waited and saw something white come through the trees The next day we came here in daytime and she lay there Did she not friend John Yes That night we were just in time One more so small child was missing and we find it thank God unharmed amongst the graves Yesterday I came here before sundown for at sundown the UnDead can move I waited here all the night till the sun rose but I saw nothing It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic which the UnDead cannot bear and other things which they shun Last night there was no exodus so tonight before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things And so it is we find this coffin empty But bear with me So far there is much that is strange Wait you with me outside unseen and unheard and things much stranger are yet to be Sohere he shut the dark slide of his lanternnow to the outside He opened the door and we filed out he coming last and locking the door behind him Oh but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault How sweet it was to see the clouds race by and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passinglike the gladness and sorrow of a mans life how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air that had no taint of death and decay how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city Each in his own way was solemn and overcome Arthur was silent and was I could see striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery I was myself tolerably patient and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsings conclusions Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery with hazard of all he has to stake Not being able to smoke he cut himself a goodsized plug of tobacco and began to chew As to Van Helsing he was employed in a definite way First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin waferlike biscuit which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin next he took out a doublehandful of some whitish stuff like dough or putty He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands This he then took and rolling it into thin strips began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb I was somewhat puzzled at this and being close asked him what it was that he was doing Arthur and Quincey drew near also as they too were curious He answered I am closing the tomb so that the UnDead may not enter And is that stuff you have put there going to do it asked Quincey Great Scott Is this a game It is What is that which you are using This time the question was by Arthur Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered The Host I brought it from Amsterdam I have an Indulgence It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professors a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things it was impossible to distrust In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb but hidden from the sight of any one approaching I pitied the others especially Arthur I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror and yet I who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs felt my heart sink within me Never did tombs look so ghastly white never did cypress or yew or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously never did bough creak so mysteriously and never did the faraway howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night There was a long spell of silence a big aching void and then from the Professor a keen Ssss He pointed and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advancea dim white figure which held something dark at its breast The figure stopped and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a darkhaired woman dressed in the cerements of the grave We could not see the face for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fairhaired child There was a pause and a sharp little cry such as a child gives in sleep or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams We were starting forward but the Professors warning hand seen by us as he stood behind a yewtree kept us back and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again It was now near enough for us to see clearly and the moonlight still held My own heart grew cold as ice and I could hear the gasp of Arthur as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra Lucy Westenra but yet how changed The sweetness was turned to adamantine heartless cruelty and the purity to voluptuous wantonness Van Helsing stepped out and obedient to his gesture we all advanced too the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide by the concentrated light that fell on Lucys face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn deathrobe We shuddered with horror I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsings iron nerve had failed Arthur was next to me and if I had not seized his arm and held him up he would have fallen When LucyI call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shapesaw us she drew back with an angry snarl such as a cat gives when taken unawares then her eyes ranged over us Lucys eyes in form and colour but Lucys eyes unclean and full of hellfire instead of the pure gentle orbs we knew At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing had she then to be killed I could have done it with savage delight As she looked her eyes blazed with unholy light and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile Oh God how it made me shudder to see it With a careless motion she flung to the ground callous as a devil the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast growling over it as a dog growls over a bone The child gave a sharp cry and lay there moaning There was a coldbloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands She still advanced however and with a languorous voluptuous grace said Come to me Arthur Leave these others and come to me My arms are hungry for you Come and we can rest together Come my husband come There was something diabolically sweet in her tonessomething of the tingling of glass when struckwhich rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another As for Arthur he seemed under a spell moving his hands from his face he opened wide his arms She was leaping for them when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix She recoiled from it and with a suddenly distorted face full of rage dashed past him as if to enter the tomb When within a foot or two of the door however she stopped as if arrested by some irresistible force Then she turned and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp which had now no quiver from Van Helsings iron nerves Never did I see such baffled malice on a face and never I trust shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes The beautiful colour became livid the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hellfire the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusas snakes and the lovely bloodstained mouth grew to an open square as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese If ever a face meant deathif looks could killwe saw it at that moment And so for full half a minute which seemed an eternity she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur Answer me oh my friend Am I to proceed in my work Arthur threw himself on his knees and hid his face in his hands as he answered Do as you will friend do as you will There can be no horror like this ever any more and he groaned in spirit Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him and took his arms We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down coming close to the tomb he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw when he stood back the woman with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own pass in through the interstice where scarce a knifeblade could have gone We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door When this was done he lifted the child and said Come now my friends we can do no more till tomorrow There is a funeral at noon so here we shall all come before long after that The friends of the dead will all be gone by two and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain Then there is more to do but not like this of tonight As for this little one he is not much harm and by tomorrow night he shall be well We shall leave him where the police will find him as on the other night and then to home Coming close to Arthur he said My friend Arthur you have had a sore trial but after when you look back you will see how it was necessary You are now in the bitter waters my child By this time tomorrow you will please God have passed them and have drunk of the sweet waters so do not mourn overmuch Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me Arthur and Quincey came home with me and we tried to cheer each other on the way We had left the child in safety and were tired so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep      29 September nightA little before twelve oclock we threeArthur Quincey Morris and myselfcalled for the Professor It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes Of course Arthur wore black for he was in deep mourning but the rest of us wore it by instinct We got to the churchyard by halfpast one and strolled about keeping out of official observation so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone had locked the gate we had the place all to ourselves Van Helsing instead of his little black bag had with him a long leather one something like a cricketing bag it was manifestly of fair weight When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road we silently and as if by ordered intention followed the Professor to the tomb He unlocked the door and we entered closing it behind us Then he took from his bag the lantern which he lit and also two wax candles which when lighted he stuck by melting their own ends on other coffins so that they might give light sufficient to work by When he again lifted the lid off Lucys coffin we all lookedArthur trembling like an aspenand saw that the body lay there in all its deathbeauty But there was no love in my own heart nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucys shape without her soul I could see even Arthurs face grow hard as he looked Presently he said to Van Helsing Is this really Lucys body or only a demon in her shape It is her body and yet not it But wait a while and you all see her as she was and is She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there the pointed teeth the bloodstained voluptuous mouthwhich it made one shudder to seethe whole carnal and unspiritual appearance seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucys sweet purity Van Helsing with his usual methodicalness began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder and then a small oillamp which gave out when lit in a corner of the tomb gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame then his operating knives which he placed to hand and last a round wooden stake some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire and was sharpened to a fine point With this stake came a heavy hammer such as in households is used in the coalcellar for breaking the lumps To me a doctors preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation They both however kept their courage and remained silent and quiet When all was ready Van Helsing said Before we do anything let me tell you this it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the UnDead When they become such there comes with the change the curse of immortality they cannot die but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world for all that die from the preying of the UnDead becomes themselves UnDead and prey on their kind And so the circle goes on ever widening like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water Friend Arthur if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die or again last night when you open your arms to her you would in time when you had died have become nosferatu as they call it in Eastern Europe and would all time make more of those UnDeads that so have fill us with horror The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse but if she live on UnDead more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth But if she die in truth then all cease the tiny wounds of the throats disappear and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been But of the most blessed of all when this now UnDead be made to rest as true dead then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day she shall take her place with the other Angels So that my friend it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free To this I am willing but is there none amongst us who has a better right Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not It was my hand that sent her to the stars it was the hand of him that loved her best the hand that of all she would herself have chosen had it been to her to choose Tell me if there be such a one amongst us We all looked at Arthur He saw too what we all did the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy and not an unholy memory he stepped forward and said bravely though his hand trembled and his face was as pale as snow My true friend from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you Tell me what I am to do and I shall not falter Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder and said Brave lad A moments courage and it is done This stake must be driven through her It will be a fearful ordealbe not deceived in thatbut it will be only a short time and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air But you must not falter when once you have begun Only think that we your true friends are round you and that we pray for you all the time Go on said Arthur hoarsely Tell me what I am to do Take this stake in your left hand ready to place the point over the heart and the hammer in your right Then when we begin our prayer for the deadI shall read him I have here the book and the others shall followstrike in Gods name that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the UnDead pass away Arthur took the stake and the hammer and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read and Quincey and I followed as well as we could Arthur placed the point over the heart and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh Then he struck with all his might The Thing in the coffin writhed and a hideous bloodcurdling screech came from the opened red lips The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam But Arthur never faltered He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell driving deeper and deeper the mercybearing stake whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it His face was set and high duty seemed to shine through it the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less and the teeth seemed to champ and the face to quiver Finally it lay still The terrible task was over The hammer fell from Arthurs hand He reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead and his breath came in broken gasps It had indeed been an awful strain on him and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it For a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin When we did however a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose for he had been seated on the ground and came and looked too and then a glad strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it There in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it but Lucy as we had seen her in her life with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity True that there were there as we had seen them in life the traces of care and pain and waste but these were all dear to us for they marked her truth to what we knew One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthurs shoulder and said to him And now Arthur my friend dear lad am I not forgiven The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old mans hand in his and raising it to his lips pressed it and said Forgiven God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again and me peace He put his hands on the Professors shoulder and laying his head on his breast cried for a while silently whilst we stood unmoving When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him And now my child you may kiss her Kiss her dead lips if you will as she would have you to if for her to choose For she is not a grinning devil nownot any more a foul Thing for all eternity No longer she is the devils UnDead She is Gods true dead whose soul is with Him Arthur bent and kissed her and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake leaving the point of it in the body Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic We soldered up the leaden coffin screwed on the coffinlid and gathering up our belongings came away When the Professor locked the door he gave the key to Arthur Outside the air was sweet the sun shone and the birds sang and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch There was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere for we were at rest ourselves on one account and we were glad though it was with a tempered joy Before we moved away Van Helsing said Now my friends one step of our work is done one the most harrowing to ourselves But there remains a greater task to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out I have clues which we can follow but it is a long task and a difficult and there is danger in it and pain Shall you not all help me We have learned to believe all of usis it not so And since so do we not see our duty Yes And do we not promise to go on to the bitter end Each in turn we took his hand and the promise was made Then said the Professor as we moved off Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend John I shall entreat two others two that you know not as yet and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold Friend John you come with me home for I have much to consult about and you can help me Tonight I leave for Amsterdam but shall return tomorrow night And then begins our great quest But first I shall have much to say so that you may know what is to do and to dread Then our promise shall be made to each other anew for there is a terrible task before us and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back CHAPTER XVII DR SEWARDS DIARYcontinued When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel Van Helsing found a telegram waiting for him Am coming up by train Jonathan at Whitby Important newsMINA HARKER The Professor was delighted Ah that wonderful Madam Mina he said pearl among women She arrive but I cannot stay She must go to your house friend John You must meet her at the station Telegraph her en route so that she may be prepared When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea over it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad and gave me a typewritten copy of it as also of Mrs Harkers diary at Whitby Take these he said and study them well When I have returned you will be master of all the facts and we can then better enter on our inquisition Keep them safe for there is in them much of treasure You will need all your faith even you who have had such an experience as that of today What is here told he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another or it may sound the knell of the UnDead who walk the earth Read all I pray you with the open mind and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so for it is allimportant You have kept diary of all these so strange things is it not so Yes Then we shall go through all these together when we meet He then made ready for his departure and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street I took my way to Paddington where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in The crowd melted away after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms and I was beginning to feel uneasy lest I might miss my guest when a sweetfaced daintylooking girl stepped up to me and after a quick glance said Dr Seward is it not And you are Mrs Harker I answered at once whereupon she held out her hand I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy but She stopped suddenly and a quick blush overspread her face The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease for it was a tacit answer to her own I got her luggage which included a typewriter and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street after I had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sittingroom and bedroom prepared at once for Mrs Harker In due time we arrived She knew of course that the place was a lunatic asylum but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered She told me that if she might she would come presently to my study as she had much to say So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst I await her As yet I have not had the chance of looking at the papers which Van Helsing left with me though they lie open before me I must get her interested in something so that I may have an opportunity of reading them She does not know how precious time is or what a task we have in hand I must be careful not to frighten her Here she is Mina Harkers Journal 29 SeptemberAfter I had tidied myself I went down to Dr Sewards study At the door I paused a moment for I thought I heard him talking with some one As however he had pressed me to be quick I knocked at the door and on his calling out Come in I entered To my intense surprise there was no one with him He was quite alone and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the description to be a phonograph I had never seen one and was much interested I hope I did not keep you waiting I said but I stayed at the door as I heard you talking and thought there was some one with you Oh he replied with a smile I was only entering my diary Your diary I asked him in surprise Yes he answered I keep it in this As he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph I felt quite excited over it and blurted out Why this beats even shorthand May I hear it say something Certainly he replied with alacrity and stood up to put it in train for speaking Then he paused and a troubled look overspread his face The fact is he began awkwardly I only keep my diary in it and as it is entirelyalmost entirelyabout my cases it may be awkwardthat is I mean He stopped and I tried to help him out of his embarrassment You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end Let me hear how she died for all that I know of her I shall be very grateful She was very very dear to me To my surprise he answered with a horrorstruck look in his face Tell you of her death Not for the wide world Why not I asked for some grave terrible feeling was coming over me Again he paused and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse At length he stammered out You see I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him and he said with unconscious simplicity in a different voice and with the navet of a child Thats quite true upon my honour Honest Indian I could not but smile at which he grimaced I gave myself away that time he said But do you know that although I have kept the diary for months past it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being and I said boldly Then Dr Seward you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said No no no For all the world I wouldnt let you know that terrible story Then it was terrible my intuition was right For a moment I thought and as my eyes ranged the room unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table His eyes caught the look in mine and without his thinking followed their direction As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning You do not know me I said When you have read those papersmy own diary and my husbands also which I have typedyou will know me better I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause but of course you do not know meyet and I must not expect you to trust me so far He is certainly a man of noble nature poor dear Lucy was right about him He stood up and opened a large drawer in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax and said You are quite right I did not trust you because I did not know you But I know you now and let me say that I should have known you long ago I know that Lucy told you of me she told me of you too May I make the only atonement in my power Take the cylinders and hear themthe first halfdozen of them are personal to me and they will not horrify you then you will know me better Dinner will by then be ready In the meantime I shall read over some of these documents and shall be better able to understand certain things He carried the phonograph himself up to my sittingroom and adjusted it for me Now I shall learn something pleasant I am sure for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which I know one side already Dr Sewards Diary 29 SeptemberI was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without thinking Mrs Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner so I said She is possibly tired let dinner wait an hour and I went on with my work I had just finished Mrs Harkers diary when she came in She looked sweetly pretty but very sad and her eyes were flushed with crying This somehow moved me much Of late I have had cause for tears God knows but the relief of them was denied me and now the sight of those sweet eyes brightened with recent tears went straight to my heart So I said as gently as I could I greatly fear I have distressed you Oh no not distressed me she replied but I have been more touched than I can say by your grief That is a wonderful machine but it is cruelly true It told me in its very tones the anguish of your heart It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God No one must hear them spoken ever again See I have tried to be useful I have copied out the words on my typewriter and none other need now hear your heart beat as I did No one need ever know shall ever know I said in a low voice She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely Ah but they must Must But why I asked Because it is a part of the terrible story a part of poor dear Lucys death and all that led to it because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery You will let me help will you not I know all up to a certain point and I see already though your diary only took me to 7 September how poor Lucy was beset and how her terrible doom was being wrought out Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us He is gone to Whitby to get more information and he will be here tomorrow to help us We need have no secrets amongst us working together and with absolute trust we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark She looked at me so appealingly and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing that I gave in at once to her wishes You shall I said do as you like in the matter God forgive me if I do wrong There are terrible things yet to learn of but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor Lucys death you will not be content I know to remain in the dark Nay the endthe very endmay give you a gleam of peace Come there is dinner We must keep one another strong for what is before us we have a cruel and dreadful task When you have eaten you shall learn the rest and I shall answer any questions you askif there be anything which you do not understand though it was apparent to us who were present Mina Harkers Journal 29 SeptemberAfter dinner I came with Dr Seward to his study He brought back the phonograph from my room and I took my typewriter He placed me in a comfortable chair and arranged the phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up and showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause Then he very thoughtfully took a chair with his back to me so that I might be as free as possible and began to read I put the forked metal to my ears and listened When the terrible story of Lucys death andand all that followed was done I lay back in my chair powerless Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition When Dr Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation and hurriedly taking a casebottle from a cupboard gave me some brandy which in a few minutes somewhat restored me My brain was all in a whirl and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors the holy ray of light that my dear dear Lucy was at last at peace I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene It is all so wild and mysterious and strange that if I had not known Jonathans experience in Transylvania I could not have believed As it was I didnt know what to believe and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else I took the cover off my typewriter and said to Dr Seward Let me write this all out now We must be ready for Dr Van Helsing when he comes I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby In this matter dates are everything and I think that if we get all our material ready and have every item put in chronological order we shall have done much You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr Morris are coming too Let us be able to tell him when they come He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder I used manifold and so took three copies of the diary just as I had done with all the rest It was late when I got through but Dr Seward went about his work of going his round of the patients when he had finished he came back and sat near me reading so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked How good and thoughtful he is the world seems full of good meneven if there are monsters in it Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professors perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at Exeter so seeing that Dr Seward keeps his newspapers I borrowed the files of The Westminster Gazette and The Pall Mall Gazette and took them to my room I remember how much The Dailygraph and The Whitby Gazette of which I had made cuttings helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed so I shall look through the evening papers since then and perhaps I shall get some new light I am not sleepy and the work will help to keep me quiet Dr Sewards Diary 30 SeptemberMr Harker arrived at nine oclock He had got his wifes wire just before starting He is uncommonly clever if one can judge from his face and full of energy If this journal be trueand judging by ones own wonderful experiences it must behe is also a man of great nerve That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring After reading his account of it I was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood but hardly the quiet businesslike gentleman who came here today      LaterAfter lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter They are hard at it Mrs Harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them He is now reading his wifes typescript of my diary I wonder what they make out of it Here it is Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the Counts hidingplace Goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript Oh if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy Stop that way madness lies Harker has gone back and is again collating his material He says that by dinnertime they will be able to show a whole connected narrative He thinks that in the meantime I should see Renfield as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count I hardly see this yet but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall What a good thing that Mrs Harker put my cylinders into type We never could have found the dates otherwise I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded smiling benignly At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever saw I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects all of which he treated naturally He then of his own accord spoke of going home a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here In fact he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once I believe that had I not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts I should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation As it is I am darkly suspicious All those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the Count What then does this absolute content mean Can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampires ultimate triumph Stay he is himself zophagous and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of master This all seems confirmation of our idea However after a while I came away my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions He might begin to think and then So I came away I mistrust these quiet moods of his so I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him and to have a straitwaistcoat ready in case of need Jonathan Harkers Journal 29 September in train to LondonWhen I received Mr Billingtons courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make on the spot such inquiries as I wanted It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Counts to its place in London Later we may be able to deal with it Billington junior a nice lad met me at the station and brought me to his fathers house where they had decided that I must stay the night They are hospitable with true Yorkshire hospitality give a guest everything and leave him free to do as he likes They all knew that I was busy and that my stay was short and Mr Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Counts table before I knew of his diabolical plans Everything had been carefully thought out and done systematically and with precision He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out To use an Americanism he had taken no chances and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled was simply the logical result of his care I saw the invoice and took note of it Fifty cases of common earth to be used for experimental purposes Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson and their reply of both of these I got copies This was all the information Mr Billington could give me so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards the Customs officers and the harbourmaster They had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship which is already taking its place in local tradition but no one could add to the simple description Fifty cases of common earth I then saw the stationmaster who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes Their tally was exact with the list and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were main and mortal heavy and that shifting them was dry work One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasnt any gentleman suchlike as yourself squire to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it Needless to add I took care before leaving to lift for ever and adequately this source of reproach      30 SeptemberThe stationmaster was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the stationmaster at Kings Cross so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes He too put me at once in communication with the proper officials and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited a noble use of them had however been made and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner From thence I went on to Carter Patersons central office where I met with the utmost courtesy They looked up the transaction in their daybook and letterbook and at once telephoned to their Kings Cross office for more details By good fortune the men who did the teaming were waiting for work and the official at once sent them over sending also by one of them the waybill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly the carriers men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details These were I shortly found connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators On my affording an opportunity through the medium of the currency of the realm of the allaying at a later period this beneficial evil one of the men remarked That ere ouse guvnor is the rummiest I ever was in Blyme but it aint been touched sence a hundred years There was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep on it without urtin of yer bones an the place was that neglected that yer might ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it But the ole chapelthat took the cike that did Me and my mate we thort we wouldnt never git out quick enough Lor I wouldnt take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark Having been in the house I could well believe him but if he knew what I know he would I think have raised his terms Of one thing I am now satisfied that all the boxes which arrived at Whitby from Varna in the Demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax There should be fifty of them there unless any have since been removedas from Dr Sewards diary I fear I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when Renfield attacked them By following up this clue we may learn a good deal      LaterMina and I have worked all day and we have put all the papers into order Mina Harkers Journal 30 SeptemberI am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself It is I suppose the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as I could but I was sick with apprehension The effort has however done him good He was never so resolute never so strong never so full of volcanic energy as at present It is just as that dear good Professor Van Helsing said he is true grit and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature He came back full of life and hope and determination we have got everything in order for tonight I feel myself quite wild with excitement I suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count That is just it this Thing is not humannot even beast To read Dr Sewards account of poor Lucys death and what followed is enough to dry up the springs of pity in ones heart      LaterLord Godalming and Mr Morris arrived earlier than we expected Dr Seward was out on business and had taken Jonathan with him so I had to see them It was to me a painful meeting for it brought back all poor dear Lucys hopes of only a few months ago Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me and it seemed that Dr Van Helsing too has been quite blowing my trumpet as Mr Morris expressed it Poor fellows neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to Lucy They did not quite know what to say or do as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge so they had to keep on neutral subjects However I thought the matter over and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date I knew from Dr Sewards diary that they had been at Lucys deathher real deathand that I need not fear to betray any secret before the time So I told them as well as I could that I had read all the papers and diaries and that my husband and I having typewritten them had just finished putting them in order I gave them each a copy to read in the library When Lord Godalming got his and turned it overit does make a pretty good pilehe said Did you write all this Mrs Harker I nodded and he went on I dont quite see the drift of it but you people are all so good and kind and have been working so earnestly and so energetically that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you I have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life Besides I know you loved my poor Lucy Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands I could hear the tears in his voice Mr Morris with instinctive delicacy just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder and then walked quietly out of the room I suppose there is something in womans nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly I sat down beside him and took his hand I hope he didnt think it forward of me and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought There I wrong him I know he never willhe is too true a gentleman I said to him for I could see that his heart was breaking I loved dear Lucy and I know what she was to you and what you were to her She and I were like sisters and now she is gone will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble I know what sorrows you have had though I cannot measure the depth of them If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction wont you let me be of some little servicefor Lucys sake In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief It seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once He grew quite hysterical and raising his open hands beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief He stood up and then sat down again and the tears rained down his cheeks I felt an infinite pity for him and opened my arms unthinkingly With a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child whilst he shook with emotion We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the motherspirit is invoked I felt this big sorrowing mans head resting on me as though it were that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child I never thought at the time how strange it all was After a little bit his sobs ceased and he raised himself with an apology though he made no disguise of his emotion He told me that for days and nights pastweary days and sleepless nightshe had been unable to speak with any one as a man must speak in his time of sorrow There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him or with whom owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded he could speak freely I know now how I suffered he said as he dried his eyes but I do not know even yetand none other can ever knowhow much your sweet sympathy has been to me today I shall know better in time and believe me that though I am not ungrateful now my gratitude will grow with my understanding You will let me be like a brother will you not for all our livesfor dear Lucys sake For dear Lucys sake I said as we clasped hands Ay and for your own sake he added for if a mans esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning you have won mine today If ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a mans help believe me you will not call in vain God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life but if it should ever come promise me that you will let me know He was so earnest and his sorrow was so fresh that I felt it would comfort him so I said I promise As I came along the corridor I saw Mr Morris looking out of a window He turned as he heard my footsteps How is Art he said Then noticing my red eyes he went on Ah I see you have been comforting him Poor old fellow he needs it No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart and he had no one to comfort him He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him I saw the manuscript in his hand and I knew that when he read it he would realise how much I knew so I said to him I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart Will you let me be your friend and will you come to me for comfort if you need it You will know later on why I speak He saw that I was in earnest and stooping took my hand and raising it to his lips kissed it It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul and impulsively I bent over and kissed him The tears rose in his eyes and there was a momentary choking in his throat he said quite calmly Little girl you will never regret that truehearted kindness so long as ever you live Then he went into the study to his friend Little girlthe very words he had used to Lucy and oh but he proved himself a friend CHAPTER XVIII DR SEWARDS DIARY 30 SeptemberI got home at five oclock and found that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife had made and arranged Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers men of whom Dr Hennessey had written to me Mrs Harker gave us a cup of tea and I can honestly say that for the first time since I have lived in it this old house seemed like home When we had finished Mrs Harker said Dr Seward may I ask a favour I want to see your patient Mr Renfield Do let me see him What you have said of him in your diary interests me so much She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her and there was no possible reason why I should so I took her with me When I went into the room I told the man that a lady would like to see him to which he simply answered Why She is going through the house and wants to see every one in it I answered Oh very well he said let her come in by all means but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place His method of tidying was peculiar he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him It was quite evident that he feared or was jealous of some interference When he had got through his disgusting task he said cheerfully Let the lady come in and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent I remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study and I took care to stand where I could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunaticfor easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect She walked over to him smiling pleasantly and held out her hand Goodevening Mr Renfield said she You see I know you for Dr Seward has told me of you He made no immediate reply but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face This look gave way to one of wonder which merged in doubt then to my intense astonishment he said Youre not the girl the doctor wanted to marry are you You cant be you know for shes dead Mrs Harker smiled sweetly as she replied Oh no I have a husband of my own to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr Seward or he me I am Mrs Harker Then what are you doing here My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr Seward Then dont stay But why not I thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs Harker any more than it was to me so I joined in How did you know I wanted to marry any one His reply was simply contemptuous given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs Harker to me instantly turning them back again What an asinine question I dont see that at all Mr Renfield said Mrs Harker at once championing me He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me You will of course understand Mrs Harker that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is everything regarding him is of interest in our little community Dr Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends but even by his patients who being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium are apt to distort causes and effects Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi I positively opened my eyes at this new development Here was my own pet lunaticthe most pronounced of his type that I had ever met withtalking elemental philosophy and with the manner of a polished gentleman I wonder if it was Mrs Harkers presence which had touched some chord in his memory If this new phase was spontaneous or in any way due to her unconscious influence she must have some rare gift or power We continued to talk for some time and seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable she ventured looking at me questioningly as she began to lead him to his favourite topic I was again astonished for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things Why I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief Indeed it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed and insisted on my being put under control I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity and that by consuming a multitude of live things no matter how low in the scale of creation one might indefinitely prolong life At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his bloodrelying of course upon the Scriptural phrase For the blood is the life Though indeed the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt Isnt that true doctor I nodded assent for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either think or say it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before Looking at my watch I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing so I told Mrs Harker that it was time to leave She came at once after saying pleasantly to Mr Renfield Goodbye and I hope I may see you often under auspices pleasanter to yourself to which to my astonishment he replied Goodbye my dear I pray God I may never see your sweet face again May He bless and keep you When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind me Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took ill and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy He saw me at once and rushed up to me saying Ah friend John how goes all Well So I have been busy for I come here to stay if need be All affairs are settled with me and I have much to tell Madam Mina is with you Yes And her so fine husband And Arthur and my friend Quincey they are with you too Good As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs Harkers suggestion at which the Professor interrupted me Ah that wonderful Madam Mina She has mans braina brain that a man should have were he much giftedand a womans heart The good God fashioned her for a purpose believe me when He made that so good combination Friend John up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us after tonight she must not have to do with this so terrible affair It is not good that she run a risk so great We men are determinednay are we not pledgedto destroy this monster but it is no part for a woman Even if she be not harmed her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors and hereafter she may sufferboth in waking from her nerves and in sleep from her dreams And besides she is young woman and not so long married there may be other things to think of some time if not now You tell me she has wrote all then she must consult with us but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work and we go alone I agreed heartily with him and then I told him what we had found in his absence that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own He was amazed and a great concern seemed to come on him Oh that we had known it before he said for then we might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy However the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards as you say We shall not think of that but go on our way to the end Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs Harker I am told Madam Mina by my friend John that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been up to this moment Not up to this moment Professor she said impulsively but up to this morning But why not up to now We have seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made We have told our secrets and yet no one who has told is the worse for it Mrs Harker began to blush and taking a paper from her pockets she said Dr Van Helsing will you read this and tell me if it must go in It is my record of today I too have seen the need of putting down at present everything however trivial but there is little in this except what is personal Must it go in The Professor read it over gravely and handed it back saying It need not go in if you do not wish it but I pray that it may It can but make your husband love you the more and all us your friends more honour youas well as more esteem and love She took it back with another blush and a bright smile And so now up to this very hour all the records we have are complete and in order The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner and before our meeting which is fixed for nine oclock The rest of us have already read everything so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy Mina Harkers Journal 30 SeptemberWhen we met in Dr Sewards study two hours after dinner which had been at six oclock we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table to which Dr Seward motioned him as he came into the room He made me sit next to him on his right and asked me to act as secretary Jonathan sat next to me Opposite us were Lord Godalming Dr Seward and Mr MorrisLord Godalming being next the Professor and Dr Seward in the centre The Professor said I may I suppose take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers We all expressed assent and he went on Then it were I think good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal I shall then make known to you something of the history of this man which has been ascertained for me So we then can discuss how we shall act and can take our measure according There are such beings as vampires some of us have evidence that they exist Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples I admit that at the first I was sceptic Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear See see I prove I prove Alas Had I known at the first what now I knownay had I even guess at himone so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her But that is gone and we must so work that other poor souls perish not whilst we can save The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once He is only stronger and being stronger have yet more power to work evil This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men he is of cunning more than mortal for his cunning be the growth of ages he have still the aids of necromancy which is as his etymology imply the divination by the dead and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command he is brute and more than brute he is devil in callous and the heart of him is not he can within limitations appear at will when and where and in any of the forms that are to him he can within his range direct the elements the storm the fog the thunder he can command all the meaner things the rat and the owl and the batthe moth and the fox and the wolf he can grow and become small and he can at times vanish and come unknown How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him How shall we find his where and having found it how can we destroy My friends this is much it is a terrible task that we undertake and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win and then where end we Life is nothings I heed him not But to fail here is not mere life or death It is that we become as him that we henceforward become foul things of the night like himwithout heart or conscience preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut for who shall open them to us again We go on for all time abhorred by all a blot on the face of Gods sunshine an arrow in the side of Him who died for man But we are face to face with duty and in such case must we shrink For me I say no but then I am old and life with his sunshine his fair places his song of birds his music and his love lie far behind You others are young Some have seen sorrow but there are fair days yet in store What say you Whilst he was speaking Jonathan had taken my hand I feared oh so much that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out but it was life to me to feel its touchso strong so selfreliant so resolute A brave mans hand can speak for itself it does not even need a womans love to hear its music When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes and I in his there was no need for speaking between us I answer for Mina and myself he said Count me in Professor said Mr Quincey Morris laconically as usual I am with you said Lord Godalming for Lucys sake if for no other reason Dr Seward simply nodded The Professor stood up and after laying his golden crucifix on the table held out his hand on either side I took his right hand and Lord Godalming his left Jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to Mr Morris So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made I felt my heart icy cold but it did not even occur to me to draw back We resumed our places and Dr Van Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun It was to be taken as gravely and in as businesslike a way as any other transaction of life Well you know what we have to contend against but we too are not without strength We have on our side power of combinationa power denied to the vampire kind we have sources of science we are free to act and think and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally In fact so far as our powers extend they are unfettered and we are free to use them We have selfdevotion in a cause and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one These things are much Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict and how the individual cannot In fine let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general and of this one in particular All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions These do not at the first appear much when the matter is one of life and deathnay of more than either life or death Yet must we be satisfied in the first place because we have to beno other means is at our controland secondly because after all these thingstradition and superstitionare everything Does not the belief in vampires rest for othersthough not alas for uson them A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility in the midst of our scientific sceptical matteroffact nineteenth century We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes Take it then that the vampire and the belief in his limitations and his cure rest for the moment on the same base For let me tell you he is known everywhere that men have been In old Greece in old Rome he flourish in Germany all over in France in India even in the Chernosese and in China so far from us in all ways there even is he and the peoples fear him at this day He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander the devilbegotten Hun the Slav the Saxon the Magyar So far then we have all we may act upon and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience The vampire live on and cannot die by mere passing of the time he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living Even more we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger that his vital faculties grow strenuous and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty But he cannot flourish without this diet he eat not as others Even friend Jonathan who lived with him for weeks did never see him to eat never He throws no shadow he make in the mirror no reflect as again Jonathan observe He has the strength of many of his handwitness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs and when he help him from the diligence too He can transform himself to wolf as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby when he tear open the dog he can be as bat as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy He can come in mist which he createthat noble ships captain proved him of this but from what we know the distance he can make this mist is limited and it can only be round himself He come on moonlight rays as elemental dustas again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula He become so smallwe ourselves saw Miss Lucy ere she was at peace slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door He can when once he find his way come out from anything or into anything no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with firesolder you call it He can see in the darkno small power this in a world which is one half shut from the light Ah but hear me through He can do all these things yet he is not free Nay he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley than the madman in his cell He cannot go where he lists he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of natures lawswhy we know not He may not enter anywhere at the first unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come though afterwards he can come as he please His power ceases as does that of all evil things at the coming of the day Only at certain times can he have limited freedom If he be not at the place whither he is bound he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset These things are we told and in this record of ours we have proof by inference Thus whereas he can do as he will within his limit when he have his earthhome his coffinhome his hellhome the place unhallowed as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby still at other time he can only change when the time come It is said too that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power as the garlic that we know of and as for things sacred as this symbol my crucifix that was amongst us even now when we resolve to them he is nothing but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect There are others too which I shall tell you of lest in our seeking we may need them The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead and as for the stake through him we know already of its peace or the cutoff head that giveth rest We have seen it with our eyes Thus when we find the habitation of this manthatwas we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him if we obey what we know But he is clever I have asked my friend Arminius of BudaPesth University to make his record and from all the means that are he tell me of what he has been He must indeed have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk over the great river on the very frontier of Turkeyland If it be so then was he no common man for in that time and for centuries after he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning as well as the bravest of the sons of the land beyond the forest That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave and are even now arrayed against us The Draculas were says Arminius a great and noble race though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One They learned his secrets in the Scholomance amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due In the records are such words as stregoicawitch ordog and pokolSatan and hell and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as wampyr which we all understand too well There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest Whilst they were talking Mr Morris was looking steadily at the window and he now got up quietly and went out of the room There was a little pause and then the Professor went on And now we must settle what we do We have here much data and we must proceed to lay out our campaign We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth all of which were delivered at Carfax we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed It seems to me that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look today or whether any more have been removed If the latter we must trace Here we were interrupted in a very startling way Outside the house came the sound of a pistolshot the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet which ricochetting from the top of the embrasure struck the far wall of the room I am afraid I am at heart a coward for I shrieked out The men all jumped to their feet Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash As he did so we heard Mr Morriss voice without Sorry I fear I have alarmed you I shall come in and tell you about it A minute later he came in and said It was an idiotic thing of me to do and I ask your pardon Mrs Harker most sincerely I fear I must have frightened you terribly But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the windowsill I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them and I went out to have a shot as I have been doing of late of evenings whenever I have seen one You used to laugh at me for it then Art Did you hit it asked Dr Van Helsing I dont know I fancy not for it flew away into the wood Without saying any more he took his seat and the Professor began to resume his statement We must trace each of these boxes and when we are ready we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair or we must so to speak sterilise the earth so that no more he can seek safety in it Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset and so engage with him when he is at his most weak And now for you Madam Mina this night is the end until all be well You are too precious to us to have such risk When we part tonight you no more must question We shall tell you all in good time We are men and are able to bear but you must be our star and our hope and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger such as we are All the men even Jonathan seemed relieved but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and perhaps lessen their safetystrength being the best safetythrough care of me but their minds were made up and though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow I could say nothing save to accept their chivalrous care of me Mr Morris resumed the discussion As there is no time to lose I vote we have a look at his house right now Time is everything with him and swift action on our part may save another victim I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close but I did not say anything for I had a greater fear that if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether They have now gone off to Carfax with means to get into the house Manlike they had told me to go to bed and sleep as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger I shall lie down and pretend to sleep lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns Dr Sewards Diary 1 October 4 a mJust as we were about to leave the house an urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at once as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning I was busy just at the moment The attendant added He seems very importunate sir I have never seen him so eager I dont know but what if you dont see him soon he will have one of his violent fits I knew the man would not have said this without some cause so I said All right Ill go now and I asked the others to wait a few minutes for me as I had to go and see my patient Take me with you friend John said the Professor His case in your diary interest me much and it had bearing too now and again on our case I should much like to see him and especial when his mind is disturbed May I come also asked Lord Godalming Me too said Quincey Morris May I come said Harker I nodded and we all went down the passage together We found him in a state of considerable excitement but far more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him There was an unusual understanding of himself which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane We all four went into the room but none of the others at first said anything His request was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery and adduced his own existing sanity I appeal to your friends he said they will perhaps not mind sitting in judgment on my case By the way you have not introduced me I was so much astonished that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment and besides there was a certain dignity in the mans manner so much of the habit of equality that I at once made the introduction Lord Godalming Professor Van Helsing Mr Quincey Morris of Texas Mr Renfield He shook hands with each of them saying in turn Lord Godalming I had the honour of seconding your father at the Windham I grieve to know by your holding the title that he is no more He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him and in his youth was I have heard the inventor of a burnt rum punch much patronised on Derby night Mr Morris you should be proud of your great state Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have farreaching effects hereafter when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing Sir I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brainmatter conventional forms are unfitting since they would seem to limit him to one of a class You gentlemen who by nationality by heredity or by the possession of natural gifts are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties And I am sure that you Dr Seward humanitarian and medicojurist as well as scientist will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances He made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm I think we were all staggered For my own part I was under the conviction despite my knowledge of the mans character and history that his reason had been restored and I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning I thought it better to wait however before making so grave a statement for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning and would then see what I could do in the direction of meeting his wishes This did not at all satisfy him for he said quickly But I fear Dr Seward that you hardly apprehend my wish I desire to go at onceherenowthis very hourthis very moment if I may Time presses and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract I am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr Seward so simple yet so momentous a wish to ensure its fulfilment He looked at me keenly and seeing the negative in my face turned to the others and scrutinised them closely Not meeting any sufficient response he went on Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition You have I said frankly but at the same time as I felt brutally There was a considerable pause and then he said slowly Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request Let me ask for this concessionboon privilege what you will I am content to implore in such a case not on personal grounds but for the sake of others I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons but you may I assure you take it from me that they are good ones sound and unselfish and spring from the highest sense of duty Could you look sir into my heart you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me Nay more you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends Again he looked at us all keenly I had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness and so determined to let him go on a little longer knowing from experience that he would like all lunatics give himself away in the end Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time but only when I thought of it afterwardsfor it was as of one addressing an equal Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free tonight I will undertake that if you will satisfy even mea stranger without prejudice and with the habit of keeping an open mindDr Seward will give you at his own risk and on his own responsibility the privilege you seek He shook his head sadly and with a look of poignant regret on his face The Professor went on Come sir bethink yourself You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness You do this whose sanity we have reason to doubt since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us Be wise and help us and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish He still shook his head as he said Dr Van Helsing I have nothing to say Your argument is complete and if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment but I am not my own master in the matter I can only ask you to trust me If I am refused the responsibility does not rest with me I thought it was now time to end the scene which was becoming too comically grave so I went towards the door simply saying Come my friends we have work to do Goodnight As however I got near the door a new change came over the patient He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack My fears however were groundless for he held up his two hands imploringly and made his petition in a moving manner As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him by restoring us more to our old relations he became still more demonstrative I glanced at Van Helsing and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes so I became a little more fixed in my manner if not more stern and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much such for instance as when he wanted a cat and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion My expectation was not realised for when he found that his appeal would not be successful he got into quite a frantic condition He threw himself on his knees and held up his hands wringing them in plaintive supplication and poured forth a torrent of entreaty with the tears rolling down his cheeks and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion Let me entreat you Dr Seward oh let me implore you to let me out of this house at once Send me away how you will and where you will send keepers with me with whips and chains let them take me in a straitwaistcoat manacled and legironed even to a gaol but let me go out of this You dont know what you do by keeping me here I am speaking from the depths of my heartof my very soul You dont know whom you wrong or how and I may not tell Woe is me I may not tell By all you hold sacredby all you hold dearby your love that is lostby your hope that livesfor the sake of the Almighty take me out of this and save my soul from guilt Cant you hear me man Cant you understand Will you never learn Dont you know that I am sane and earnest now that I am no lunatic in a mad fit but a sane man fighting for his soul Oh hear me hear me Let me go let me go let me go I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get and so would bring on a fit so I took him by the hand and raised him up Come I said sternly no more of this we have had quite enough already Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments Then without a word he rose and moving over sat down on the side of the bed The collapse had come as on former occasion just as I had expected When I was leaving the room last of our party he said to me in a quiet wellbred voice You will I trust Dr Seward do me the justice to bear in mind later on that I did what I could to convince you tonight CHAPTER XIX JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNAL 1 October 5 a mI went with the party to the search with an easy mind for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work Somehow it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all but now that her work is done and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells she may well feel that her part is finished and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us We were I think all a little upset by the scene with Mr Renfield When we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study Then Mr Morris said to Dr Seward Say Jack if that man wasnt attempting a bluff he is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw Im not sure but I believe that he had some serious purpose and if he had it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance Lord Godalming and I were silent but Dr Van Helsing added Friend John you know more of lunatics than I do and Im glad of it for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free But we live and learn and in our present task we must take no chance as my friend Quincey would say All is best as they are Dr Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way I dont know but that I agree with you If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads I cant forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth Besides he called the Count lord and master and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him so I suppose he isnt above trying to use a respectable lunatic He certainly did seem earnest though I only hope we have done what is best These things in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand help to unnerve a man The Professor stepped over and laying his hand on his shoulder said in his grave kindly way Friend John have no fear We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case we can only do as we deem best What else have we to hope for except the pity of the good God Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes but now he returned He held up a little silver whistle as he remarked That old place may be full of rats and if so Ive got an antidote on call Having passed the wall we took our way to the house taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things which he laid on the step sorting them into four little groups evidently one for each Then he spoke My friends we are going into a terrible danger and we need arms of many kinds Our enemy is not merely spiritual Remember that he has the strength of twenty men and that though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kindand therefore breakable or crushablehis are not amenable to mere strength A stronger man or a body of men more strong in all than him can at certain times hold him but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him We must therefore guard ourselves from his touch Keep this near your heartas he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me I being nearest to himput these flowers round your neckhere he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossomsfor other enemies more mundane this revolver and this knife and for aid in all these so small electric lamps which you can fasten to your breast and for all and above all at the last this which we must not desecrate needless This was a portion of Sacred Wafer which he put in an envelope and handed to me Each of the others was similarly equipped Now he said friend John where are the skeleton keys If so that we can open the door we need not break house by the window as before at Miss Lucys Dr Seward tried one or two skeleton keys his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead Presently he got one to suit after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded and with a rusty clang shot back We pressed on the door the rusty hinges creaked and it slowly opened It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr Sewards diary of the opening of Miss Westenras tomb I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others for with one accord they shrank back The Professor was the first to move forward and stepped into the open door In manus tuas Domine he said crossing himself as he passed over the threshold We closed the door behind us lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road The Professor carefully tried the lock lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms as the rays crossed each other or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us I suppose it was the recollection so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings of that terrible experience in Transylvania I think the feeling was common to us all for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow just as I felt myself doing The whole place was thick with dust The floor was seemingly inches deep except where there were recent footsteps in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust and in the corners were masses of spiders webs whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys with a timeyellowed label on each They had been used several times for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them He turned to me and said You know this place Jonathan You have copied maps of it and you know it at least more than we do Which is the way to the chapel I had an idea of its direction though on my former visit I had not been able to get admission to it so I led the way and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low arched oaken door ribbed with iron bands This is the spot said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase With a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door We were prepared for some unpleasantness for as we were opening the door a faint malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or when he was gloated with fresh blood in a ruined building open to the air but here the place was small and close and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul There was an earthy smell as of some dry miasma which came through the fouler air But as to the odour itself how shall I describe it It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent acrid smell of blood but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt Faugh it sickens me to think of it Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end but this was no ordinary case and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses We made an accurate examination of the place the Professor saying as we began The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest A glance was sufficient to show how many remained for the great earth chests were bulky and there was no mistaking them There were only twentynine left out of the fifty Once I got a fright for seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond I looked too and for an instant my heart stood still Somewhere looking out from the shadow I seemed to see the high lights of the Counts evil face the ridge of the nose the red eyes the red lips the awful pallor It was only for a moment for as Lord Godalming said I thought I saw a face but it was only the shadows and resumed his inquiry I turned my lamp in the direction and stepped into the passage There was no sign of any one and as there were no corners no doors no aperture of any kind but only the solid walls of the passage there could be no hidingplace even for him I took it that fear had helped imagination and said nothing A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner which he was examining We all followed his movements with our eyes for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence which twinkled like stars We all instinctively drew back The whole place was becoming alive with rats For a moment or two we stood appalled all save Lord Godalming who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency Rushing over to the great ironbound oaken door which Dr Seward had described from the outside and which I had seen myself he turned the key in the lock drew the huge bolts and swung the door open Then taking his little silver whistle from his pocket he blew a low shrill call It was answered from behind Dr Sewards house by the yelping of dogs and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased They seemed to swarm over the place all at once till the lamplight shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering baleful eyes made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies The dogs dashed on but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled and then simultaneously lifting their noses began to howl in most lugubrious fashion The rats were multiplying in thousands and we moved out Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs and carrying him in placed him on the floor The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage and rushed at his natural enemies They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score the other dogs who had by now been lifted in the same manner had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes We all seemed to find our spirits rise Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution We closed the outer door and barred and locked it and bringing the dogs with us began our search of the house We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbithunting in a summer wood The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front Dr Van Helsing had taken the key of the halldoor from the bunch and locked the door in orthodox fashion putting the key into his pocket when he had done So far he said our night has been eminently successful No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing More than all do I rejoice that this our firstand perhaps our most difficult and dangerousstep has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget One lesson too we have learned if it be allowable to argue a particulari that the brute beasts which are to the Counts command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power for look these rats that would come to his call just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mothers cry though they come to him they run pellmell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur We have other matters before us other dangers other fears and that monsterhe has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time tonight So be it that he has gone elsewhere Good It has given us opportunity to cry check in some ways in this chess game which we play for the stake of human souls And now let us go home The dawn is close at hand and we have reason to be content with our first nights work It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow if full of peril but we must go on and from no danger shall we shrink The house was silent when we got back save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards and a low moaning sound from Renfields room The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself after the manner of the insane with needless thoughts of pain I came tiptoe into our own room and found Mina asleep breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it She looks paler than usual I hope the meeting tonight has not upset her I am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work and even of our deliberations It is too great a strain for a woman to bear I did not think so at first but I know better now Therefore I am glad that it is settled There may be things which would frighten her to hear and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished and the earth free from a monster of the nether world I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours but I must be resolute and tomorrow I shall keep dark over tonights doings and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened I rest on the sofa so as not to disturb her      1 October laterI suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves for the day was a busy one and the night had no rest at all Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion for though I slept till the sun was high I was awake before her and had to call two or three times before she awoke Indeed she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me but looked at me with a sort of blank terror as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream She complained a little of being tired and I let her rest till later in the day We now know of twentyone boxes having been removed and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all Such will of course immensely simplify our labour and the sooner the matter is attended to the better I shall look up Thomas Snelling today Dr Sewards Diary 1 OctoberIt was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room He was more jolly and cheerful than usual and it is quite evident that last nights work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said Your patient interests me much May it be that with you I visit him this morning Or if that you are too occupy I can go alone if it may be It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy and reason so sound I had some work to do which pressed so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad as then I should not have to keep him waiting so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient But he answered I want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things He said to Madam Mina as I see in your diary of yesterday that he had once had such a belief Why do you smile friend John Excuse me I said but the answer is here I laid my hand on the typewritten matter When our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume life his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs Harker entered the room Van Helsing smiled in turn Good he said Your memory is true friend John I should have remembered And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise Who knows I went on with my work and before long was through that in hand It seemed that the time had been very short indeed but there was Van Helsing back in the study Do I interrupt he asked politely as he stood at the door Not at all I answered Come in My work is finished and I am free I can go with you now if you like It is needless I have seen him Well I fear that he does not appraise me at much Our interview was short When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre with his elbows on his knees and his face was the picture of sullen discontent I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could and with such a measure of respect as I could assume He made no reply whatever Dont you know me I asked His answer was not reassuring I know you well enough you are the old fool Van Helsing I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else Damn all thickheaded Dutchmen Not a word more would he say but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic so I shall go if I may and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina Friend John it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained no more to be worried with our terrible things Though we shall much miss her help it is better so I agree with you with all my heart I answered earnestly for I did not want him to weaken in this matter Mrs Harker is better out of it Things are quite bad enough for us all men of the world and who have been in many tight places in our time but it is no place for a woman and if she had remained in touch with the affair it would in time infallibly have wrecked her So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs Harker and Harker Quincey and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earthboxes I shall finish my round of work and we shall meet tonight Mina Harkers Journal 1 OctoberIt is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am today after Jonathans full confidence for so many years to see him manifestly avoid certain matters and those the most vital of all This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday and though Jonathan was late too he was the earlier He spoke to me before he went out never more sweetly or tenderly but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Counts house And yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was Poor dear fellow I suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me They all agreed that it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work and I acquiesced But to think that he keeps anything from me And now I am crying like a silly fool when I know it comes from my husbands great love and from the good good wishes of those other strong men That has done me good Well some day Jonathan will tell me all and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept anything from him I still keep my journal as usual Then if he has feared of my trust I shall show it to him with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read I feel strangely sad and lowspirited today I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement Last night I went to bed when the men had gone simply because they told me to I didnt feel sleepy and I did feel full of devouring anxiety I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see me in London and it all seems like a horrible tragedy with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end Everything that one does seems no matter how right it may be to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored If I hadnt gone to Whitby perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now She hadnt taken to visiting the churchyard till I came and if she hadnt come there in the daytime with me she wouldnt have walked there in her sleep and if she hadnt gone there at night and asleep that monster couldnt have destroyed her as he did Oh why did I ever go to Whitby There now crying again I wonder what has come over me today I must hide it from Jonathan for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morningI who never cried on my own account and whom he has never caused to shed a tearthe dear fellow would fret his heart out I shall put a bold face on and if I do feel weepy he shall never see it I suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn I cant quite remember how I fell asleep last night I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds like praying on a very tumultuous scale from Mr Renfields room which is somewhere under this And then there was silence over everything silence so profound that it startled me and I got up and looked out of the window All was dark and silent the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own Not a thing seemed to be stirring but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate so that a thin streak of white mist that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me I lay a while but could not quite sleep so I got out and looked out of the window again The mist was spreading and was now close up to the house so that I could see it lying thick against the wall as though it were stealing up to the windows The poor man was more loud than ever and though I could not distinguish a word he said I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part Then there was the sound of a struggle and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him I was so frightened that I crept into bed and pulled the clothes over my head putting my fingers in my ears I was not then a bit sleepy at least so I thought but I must have fallen asleep for except dreams I do not remember anything until the morning when Jonathan woke me I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where I was and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me My dream was very peculiar and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in or continued in dreams I thought that I was asleep and waiting for Jonathan to come back I was very anxious about him and I was powerless to act my feet and my hands and my brain were weighted so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace And so I slept uneasily and thought Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy and dank and cold I put back the clothes from my face and found to my surprise that all was dim around The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan but turned down came only like a tiny red spark through the fog which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed I would have got out to make certain on the point but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will I lay still and endured that was all I closed my eyes but could still see through my eyelids It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us and how conveniently we can imagine The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in for I could see it like smokeor with the white energy of boiling waterpouring in not through the window but through the joinings of the door It got thicker and thicker till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room and through it all came the scriptural words a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night Was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep But the pillar was composed of both the day and the nightguiding for the fire was in the red eye which at the thought got a new fascination for me till as I looked the fire divided and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when on the cliff the dying sunlight struck the windows of St Marys Church Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight and in my dream I must have fainted for all became black darkness The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist I must be careful of such dreams for they would unseat ones reason if there were too much of them I would get Dr Van Helsing or Dr Seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep only that I fear to alarm them Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me Tonight I shall strive hard to sleep naturally If I do not I shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral that cannot hurt me for once and it will give me a good nights sleep Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all      2 October 10 p mLast night I slept but did not dream I must have slept soundly for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed but the sleep has not refreshed me for today I feel terribly weak and spiritless I spent all yesterday trying to read or lying down dozing In the afternoon Mr Renfield asked if he might see me Poor man he was very gentle and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless me Some way it affected me much I am crying when I think of him This is a new weakness of which I must be careful Jonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been crying He and the others were out till dinnertime and they all came in tired I did what I could to brighten them up and I suppose that the effort did me good for I forgot how tired I was After dinner they sent me to bed and all went off to smoke together as they said but I knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day I could see from Jonathans manner that he had something important to communicate I was not so sleepy as I should have been so before they went I asked Dr Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind as I had not slept well the night before He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught which he gave to me telling me that it would do me no harm as it was very mild I have taken it and am waiting for sleep which still keeps aloof I hope I have not done wrong for as sleep begins to flirt with me a new fear comes that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking I might want it Here comes sleep Goodnight CHAPTER XX JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNAL 1 October eveningI found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal Green but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much and he had begun too early on his expected debauch I learned however from his wife who seemed a decent poor soul that he was only the assistant to Smollet who of the two mates was the responsible person So off I drove to Walworth and found Mr Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves taking a late tea out of a saucer He is a decent intelligent fellow distinctly a good reliable type of workman and with a headpiece of his own He remembered all about the incident of the boxes and from a wonderful dogseared notebook which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick halfobliterated pencil he gave me the destinations of the boxes There were he said six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197 Chicksand Street Mile End New Town and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane Bermondsey If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London these places were chosen as the first of delivery so that later he might distribute more fully The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London He was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore on the east of the southern shore and on the south The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical schemelet alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the southwest and west I went back to Smollet and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax He replied Well guvnor youve treated me wery ansomeI had given him half a sovereignan Ill tell yer all I know I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the Are an Ounds in Pinchers Alley as ow he an his mate ad ad a rare dusty job in a old ouse at Purfect There aint amany such jobs as this ere an Im thinkin that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut I asked if he could tell me where to find him I told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another halfsovereign to him So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up saying that he was going to begin the search then and there At the door he stopped and said Look ere guvnor there aint no sense in me akeepin you ere I may find Sam soon or I maynt but anyhow he aint like to be in a way to tell ye much tonight Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it and put yer address on it Ill find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye tonight But yed better be up arter im soon in the mornin or maybe ye wont ketch im for Sam gets off main early never mind the booze the night afore This was all practical so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper and to keep the change When she came back I addressed the envelope and stamped it and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found I took my way to home Were on the track anyhow I am tired tonight and want sleep Mina is fast asleep and looks a little too pale her eyes look as though she had been crying Poor dear Ive no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others But it is best as it is It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business I must be firm for on me this particular burden of silence must rest I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances Indeed it may not be a hard task after all for she herself has become reticent on the subject and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision      2 October eveningA long and trying and exciting day By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed on which was written with a carpenters pencil in a sprawling hand Sam Bloxam Korkrans 4 Poters Cort Bartel Street Walworth Arsk for the depite I got the letter in bed and rose without waking Mina She looked heavy and sleepy and pale and far from well I determined not to wake her but that when I should return from this new search I would arrange for her going back to Exeter I think she would be happier in our own home with her daily tasks to interest her than in being here amongst us and in ignorance I only saw Dr Seward for a moment and told him where I was off to promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything I drove to Walworth and found with some difficulty Potters Court Mr Smollets spelling misled me as I asked for Poters Court instead of Potters Court However when I had found the court I had no difficulty in discovering Corcorans lodginghouse When I asked the man who came to the door for the depite he shook his head and said I dunno im There aint no such a person ere I never eard of im in all my bloomin days Dont believe there aint nobody of that kind livin ere or anywheres I took out Smollets letter and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me What are you I asked Im the depity he answered I saw at once that I was on the right track phonetic spelling had again misled me A halfcrown tip put the deputys knowledge at my disposal and I learned that Mr Bloxam who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcorans had left for his work at Poplar at five oclock that morning He could not tell me where the place of work was situated but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a newfangled wareus and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar It was twelve oclock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building and this I got at a coffeeshop where some workmen were having their dinner One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new cold storage building and as this suited the condition of a newfangled wareus I at once drove to it An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm put me on the track of Bloxam he was sent for on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter He was a smart enough fellow though rough of speech and bearing When I had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxesmain heavy oneswith a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly to which he replied Well guvnor I forgits the number but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind not long built It was a dusty old ouse too though nothin to the dustiness of the ouse we tooked the bloomin boxes from How did you get into the houses if they were both empty There was the old party what engaged me awaitin in the ouse at Purfleet He elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray Curse me but he was the strongest chap I ever struck an him a old feller with a white moustache one that thin you would think he couldnt throw a shadder How this phrase thrilled through me Why e took up is end o the boxes like they was pounds of tea and me apuffin an ablowin afore I could upend mine anyhowan Im no chicken neither How did you get into the house in Piccadilly I asked He was there too He must a started off and got there afore me for when I rung of the bell he kem an opened the door isself an elped me to carry the boxes into the all The whole nine I asked Yus there was five in the first load an four in the second It was main dry work an I dont so well remember ow I got ome I interrupted him Were the boxes left in the hall Yus it was a big all an there was nothin else in it I made one more attempt to further matters You didnt have any key Never used no key nor nothink The old gent he opened the door isself an shut it again when I druv off I dont remember the last timebut that was the beer And you cant remember the number of the house No sir But ye neednt have no difficulty about that Its a igh un with a stone front with a bow on it an igh steps up to the door I know them steps avin ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper The old gent give them shillins an they seein they got so much they wanted more but e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw im down the steps till the lot of them went away cussin I thought that with this description I could find the house so having paid my friend for his information I started off for Piccadilly I had gained a new painful experience the Count could it was evident handle the earthboxes himself If so time was precious for now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution he could by choosing his own time complete the task unobserved At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab and walked westward beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula The house looked as though it had been long untenanted The windows were encrusted with dust and the shutters were up All the framework was black with time and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away It was evident that up to lately there had been a large noticeboard in front of the balcony it had however been roughly torn away the uprights which had supported it still remaining Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards whose raw edges looked white I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the noticeboard intact as it would perhaps have given some clue to the ownership of the house I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side and nothing could be done so I went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter The mews were active the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken but he couldnt say from whom He told me however that up to very lately there had been a noticeboard of For Sale up and that perhaps Mitchell Sons  Candy the house agents could tell me something as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board I did not wish to seem too eager or to let my informant know or guess too much so thanking him in the usual manner I strolled away It was now growing dusk and the autumn night was closing in so I did not lose any time Having learned the address of Mitchell Sons  Candy from a directory at the Berkeley I was soon at their office in Sackville Street The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner but uncommunicative in equal proportion Having once told me that the Piccadilly housewhich throughout our interview he called a mansionwas sold he considered my business as concluded When I asked who had purchased it he opened his eyes a thought wider and paused a few seconds before replying It is sold sir Pardon me I said with equal politeness but I have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it Again he paused longer and raised his eyebrows still more It is sold sir was again his laconic reply Surely I said you do not mind letting me know so much But I do mind he answered The affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell Sons  Candy This was manifestly a prig of the first water and there was no use arguing with him I thought I had best meet him on his own ground so I said Your clients sir are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence I am myself a professional man Here I handed him my card In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity I act on the part of Lord Godalming who wishes to know something of the property which was he understood lately for sale These words put a different complexion on affairs He said I would like to oblige you if I could Mr Harker and especially would I like to oblige his lordship We once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur Holmwood If you will let me have his lordships address I will consult the House on the subject and will in any case communicate with his lordship by tonights post It will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship I wanted to secure a friend and not to make an enemy so I thanked him gave the address at Dr Sewards and came away It was now dark and I was tired and hungry I got a cup of tea at the Arated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet by the next train I found all the others at home Mina was looking tired and pale but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful it wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude Thank God this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task She seems somehow more reconciled or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders I am glad we made our resolution in time as with such a feeling as this our growing knowledge would be torture to her I could not tell the others of the days discovery till we were alone so after dinnerfollowed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselvesI took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever and clung to me as though she would detain me but there was much to be talked of and I came away Thank God the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in the study In the train I had written my diary so far and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information when I had finished Van Helsing said This has been a great days work friend Jonathan Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes If we find them all in that house then our work is near the end But if there be some missing we must search until we find them Then shall we make our final coup and hunt the wretch to his real death We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr Morris spoke Say how are we going to get into that house We got into the other answered Lord Godalming quickly But Art this is different We broke house at Carfax but we had night and a walled park to protect us It will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly either by day or night I confess I dont see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning Lord Godalmings brows contracted and he stood up and walked about the room Byandby he stopped and said turning from one to another of us Quinceys head is level This burglary business is getting serious we got off once all right but we have now a rare job on handunless we can find the Counts key basket As nothing could well be done before morning and as it would be at least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchells we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time For a good while we sat and smoked discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment I am very sleepy and shall go to bed Just a line Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular Her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles as though she thinks even in her sleep She is still too pale but does not look so haggard as she did this morning Tomorrow will I hope mend all this she will be herself at home in Exeter Oh but I am sleepy Dr Sewards Diary 1 OctoberI am puzzled afresh about Renfield His moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them and as they always mean something more than his own wellbeing they form a more than interesting study This morning when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing his manner was that of a man commanding destiny He was in fact commanding destinysubjectively He did not really care for any of the things of mere earth he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something so I asked him What about the flies these times He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of waysuch a smile as would have become the face of Malvolioas he answered me The fly my dear sir has one striking feature its wings are typical of the arial powers of the psychic faculties The ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically so I said quickly Oh it is a soul you are after now is it His madness foiled his reason and a puzzled look spread over his face as shaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him he said Oh no oh no I want no souls Life is all I want Here he brightened up I am pretty indifferent about it at present Life is all right I have all I want You must get a new patient doctor if you wish to study zophagy This puzzled me a little so I drew him on Then you command life you are a god I suppose He smiled with an ineffably benign superiority Oh no Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings If I may state my intellectual position I am so far as concerns things purely terrestrial somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied spiritually This was a poser to me I could not at the moment recall Enochs appositeness so I had to ask a simple question though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic And why with Enoch Because he walked with God I could not see the analogy but did not like to admit it so I harked back to what he had denied So you dont care about life and you dont want souls Why not I put my question quickly and somewhat sternly on purpose to disconcert him The effort succeeded for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner bent low before me and actually fawned upon me as he replied I dont want any souls indeed indeed I dont I couldnt use them if I had them they would be no manner of use to me I couldnt eat them or He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face like a windsweep on the surface of the water And doctor as to life what is it after all When youve got all you require and you know that you will never want that is all I have friendsgood friendslike you Dr Seward this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning I know that I shall never lack the means of life I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as hea dogged silence After a short time I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him He was sulky and so I came away Later in the day he sent for me Ordinarily I would not have come without special reason but just at present I am so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort Besides I am glad to have anything to help to pass the time Harker is out following up clues and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue He does not wish to be disturbed in the work without cause I would have taken him with me to see the patient only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again There was also another reason Renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were alone I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part When I came in he said at once as though the question had been waiting on his lips What about souls It was evident then that my surmise had been correct Unconscious cerebration was doing its work even with the lunatic I determined to have the matter out What about them yourself I asked He did not reply for a moment but looked all round him and up and down as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer I dont want any souls he said in a feeble apologetic way The matter seemed preying on his mind and so I determined to use itto be cruel only to be kind So I said You like life and you want life Oh yes but that is all right you neednt worry about that But I asked how are we to get the life without getting the soul also This seemed to puzzle him so I followed it up A nice time youll have some time when youre flying out there with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you Youve got their lives you know and you must put up with their souls Something seemed to affect his imagination for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped There was something pathetic in it that touched me it also gave me a lesson for it seemed that before me was a childonly a child though the features were worn and the stubble on the jaws was white It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance and knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him The first step was to restore confidence so I asked him speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again He seemed to wake up all at once and shook his head With a laugh he replied Not much flies are poor things after all After a pause he added But I dont want their souls buzzing round me all the same Or spiders I went on Blow spiders Whats the use of spiders There isnt anything in them to eat orhe stopped suddenly as though reminded of a forbidden topic So so I thought to myself this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word drink what does it mean Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse for he hurried on as though to distract my attention from it I dont take any stock at all in such matters Rats and mice and such small deer as Shakespeare has it chickenfeed of the larder they might be called Im past all that sort of nonsense You might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks as to try to interest me about the lesser carnivora when I know of what is before me I see I said You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in How would you like to breakfast on elephant What ridiculous nonsense you are talking He was getting too wide awake so I thought I would press him hard I wonder I said reflectively what an elephants soul is like The effect I desired was obtained for he at once fell from his highhorse and became a child again I dont want an elephants soul or any soul at all he said For a few moments he sat despondently Suddenly he jumped to his feet with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement To hell with you and your souls he shouted Why do you plague me about souls Havent I got enough to worry and pain and distract me already without thinking of souls He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit so I blew my whistle The instant however that I did so he became calm and said apologetically Forgive me Doctor I forgot myself You do not need any help I am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable If you only knew the problem I have to face and that I am working out you would pity and tolerate and pardon me Pray do not put me in a straitwaistcoat I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined I am sure you will understand He had evidently selfcontrol so when the attendants came I told them not to mind and they withdrew Renfield watched them go when the door was closed he said with considerable dignity and sweetness Dr Seward you have been very considerate towards me Believe me that I am very very grateful to you I thought it well to leave him in this mood and so I came away There is certainly something to ponder over in this mans state Several points seem to make what the American interviewer calls a story if one could only get them in proper order Here they are Will not mention drinking Fears the thought of being burdened with the soul of anything Has no dread of wanting life in the future Despises the meaner forms of life altogether though he dreads being haunted by their souls Logically all these things point one way he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life He dreads the consequencethe burden of a soul Then it is a human life he looks to And the assurance Merciful God the Count has been to him and there is some new scheme of terror afoot      LaterI went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion He grew very grave and after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to Renfield I did so As we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago When we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old the flies lethargic with the autumn were beginning to buzz into the room We tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation but he would not attend He went on with his singing just as though we had not been present He had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a notebook We had to come away as ignorant as we went in His is a curious case indeed we must watch him tonight Letter Mitchell Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming 1 October My Lord We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes We beg with regard to the desire of your Lordship expressed by Mr Harker on your behalf to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of No 347 Piccadilly The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr Archibald WinterSuffield The purchaser is a foreign nobleman Count de Ville who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes over the counter if your Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression Beyond this we know nothing whatever of him We are my Lord Your Lordships humble servants MITCHELL SONS  CANDY Dr Sewards Diary 2 OctoberI placed a man in the corridor last night and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfields room and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me After dinner when we had all gathered round the fire in the studyMrs Harker having gone to bedwe discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day Harker was the only one who had any result and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one Before going to bed I went round to the patients room and looked in through the observation trap He was sleeping soundly and his heart rose and fell with regular respiration This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly I asked him if that was all he replied that it was all he heard There was something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if he had been asleep He denied sleep but admitted to having dozed for a while It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched Today Harker is out following up his clue and Art and Quincey are looking after horses Godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose We must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset we shall thus catch the Count at his weakest and without a refuge to fly to Van Helsing is off to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine The old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in straitwaistcoats      LaterWe have met again We seem at last to be on the track and our work of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end I wonder if Renfields quiet has anything to do with this His moods have so followed the doings of the Count that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him in some subtle way If we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind between the time of my argument with him today and his resumption of flycatching it might afford us a valuable clue He is now seemingly quiet for a spell Is he That wild yell seemed to come from his room      The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had somehow met with some accident He had heard him yell and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor all covered with blood I must go at once CHAPTER XXI DR SEWARDS DIARY 3 OctoberLet me put down with exactness all that happened as well as I can remember it since last I made an entry Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten in all calmness I must proceed When I came to Renfields room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood When I went to move him it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised as though it had been beaten against the floorindeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over I think sir his back is broken See both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure He seemed quite bewildered and his brows were gathered in as he said I cant understand the two things He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her And I suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed if he got in an awkward kink But for the life of me I cant imagine how the two things occurred If his back was broke he couldnt beat his head and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed there would be marks of it I said to him Go to Dr Van Helsing and ask him to kindly come here at once I want him without an instants delay The man ran off and within a few minutes the Professor in his dressing gown and slippers appeared When he saw Renfield on the ground he looked keenly at him a moment and then turned to me I think he recognised my thought in my eyes for he said very quietly manifestly for the ears of the attendant Ah a sad accident He will need very careful watching and much attention I shall stay with you myself but I shall first dress myself If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity bearing with him a surgical case He had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up for almost before he looked at the patient he whispered to me Send the attendant away We must be alone with him when he becomes conscious after the operation So I said I think that will do now Simmons We have done all that we can at present You had better go your round and Dr Van Helsing will operate Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere The man withdrew and we went into a strict examination of the patient The wounds of the face was superficial the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull extending right up through the motor area The Professor thought a moment and said We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions as far as can be the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury The whole motor area seems affected The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly so we must trephine at once or it may be too late As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers the former spoke I heard your man call up Dr Van Helsing and tell him of an accident So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times Ive been thinking that tomorrow night will not see things as they have been Well have to look backand forward a little more than we have done May we come in I nodded and held the door open till they had entered then I closed it again When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient and noted the horrible pool on the floor he said softly My God what has happened to him Poor poor devil I told him briefly and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operationfor a short time at all events He went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed with Godalming beside him we all watched in patience We shall wait said Van Helsing just long enough to fix the best spot for trephining so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot for it is evident that the hmorrhage is increasing The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness I had a horrible sinking in my heart and from Van Helsings face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come I dreaded the words that Renfield might speak I was positively afraid to think but the conviction of what was coming was on me as I have read of men who have heard the deathwatch The poor mans breathing came in uncertain gasps Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility Inured as I was to sick beds and death this suspense grew and grew upon me I could almost hear the beating of my own heart and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer The silence finally became agonising I looked at my companions one after another and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture There was a nervous suspense over us all as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast he might die at any moment I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine His face was sternly set as he spoke There is no time to lose His words may be worth many lives I have been thinking so as I stood here It may be there is a soul at stake We shall operate just above the ear Without another word he made the operation For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous Then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest Suddenly his eyes opened and became fixed in a wild helpless stare This was continued for a few moments then it softened into a glad surprise and from the lips came a sigh of relief He moved convulsively and as he did so said Ill be quiet Doctor Tell them to take off the straitwaistcoat I have had a terrible dream and it has left me so weak that I cannot move Whats wrong with my face it feels all swollen and it smarts dreadfully He tried to turn his head but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone Tell us your dream Mr Renfield As he heard the voice his face brightened through its mutilation and he said That is Dr Van Helsing How good it is of you to be here Give me some water my lips are dry and I shall try to tell you I dreamedhe stopped and seemed fainting I called quietly to QuinceyThe brandyit is in my studyquick He flew and returned with a glass the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water We moistened the parched lips and the patient quickly revived It seemed however that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval for when he was quite conscious he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I shall never forget and said I must not deceive myself it was no dream but all a grim reality Then his eyes roved round the room as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on If I were not sure already I would know from them For an instant his eyes closednot with pain or sleep but voluntarily as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear when he opened them he said hurriedly and with more energy than he had yet displayed Quick Doctor quick I am dying I feel that I have but a few minutes and then I must go back to deathor worse Wet my lips with brandy again I have something that I must say before I die or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow Thank you It was that night after you left me when I implored you to let me go away I couldnt speak then for I felt my tongue was tied but I was as sane then except in that way as I am now I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me it seemed hours Then there came a sudden peace to me My brain seemed to become cool again and I realised where I was I heard the dogs bark behind our house but not where He was As he spoke Van Helsings eyes never blinked but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard He did not however betray himself he nodded slightly and said Go on in a low voice Renfield proceeded He came up to the window in the mist as I had seen him often before but he was solid thennot a ghost and his eyes were fierce like a mans when angry He was laughing with his red mouth the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees to where the dogs were barking I wouldnt ask him to come in at first though I knew he wanted tojust as he had wanted all along Then he began promising me thingsnot in words but by doing them He was interrupted by a word from the Professor How By making them happen just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings and big moths in the night with skull and crossbones on their backs Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously The Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphingeswhat you call the Deathshead Moth The patient went on without stopping Then he began to whisper Rats rats rats Hundreds thousands millions of them and every one a life and dogs to eat them and cats too All lives all red blood with years of life in it and not merely buzzing flies I laughed at him for I wanted to see what he could do Then the dogs howled away beyond the dark trees in His house He beckoned me to the window I got up and looked out and He raised his hands and seemed to call out without using any words A dark mass spread over the grass coming on like the shape of a flame of fire and then He moved the mist to the right and left and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing redlike His only smaller He held up his hand and they all stopped and I thought he seemed to be saying All these lives will I give you ay and many more and greater through countless ages if you will fall down and worship me And then a red cloud like the colour of blood seemed to close over my eyes and before I knew what I was doing I found myself opening the sash and saying to Him Come in Lord and Master The rats were all gone but He slid into the room through the sash though it was only open an inch widejust as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour His voice was weaker so I moistened his lips with the brandy again and he continued but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced I was about to call him back to the point but Van Helsing whispered to me Let him go on Do not interrupt him he cannot go back and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought He proceeded All day I waited to hear from him but he did not send me anything not even a blowfly and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him When he slid in through the window though it was shut and did not even knock I got mad with him He sneered at me and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming and he went on as though he owned the whole place and I was no one He didnt even smell the same as he went by me I couldnt hold him I thought that somehow Mrs Harker had come into the room The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over standing behind him so that he could not see them but where they could hear better They were both silent but the Professor started and quivered his face however grew grimmer and sterner still Renfield went on without noticing When Mrs Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasnt the same it was like tea after the teapot had been watered Here we all moved but no one said a word he went on I didnt know that she was here till she spoke and she didnt look the same I dont care for the pale people I like them with lots of blood in them and hers had all seemed to have run out I didnt think of it at the time but when she went away I began to think and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her I could feel that the rest quivered as I did but we remained otherwise still So when He came tonight I was ready for Him I saw the mist stealing in and I grabbed it tight I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength and as I knew I was a madmanat times anyhowI resolved to use my power Ay and He felt it too for He had to come out of the mist to struggle with me I held tight and I thought I was going to win for I didnt mean Him to take any more of her life till I saw His eyes They burned into me and my strength became like water He slipped through it and when I tried to cling to Him He raised me up and flung me down There was a red cloud before me and a noise like thunder and the mist seemed to steal away under the door His voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous Van Helsing stood up instinctively We know the worst now he said He is here and we know his purpose It may not be too late Let us be armedthe same as we were the other night but lose no time there is not an instant to spare There was no need to put our fear nay our conviction into wordswe shared them in common We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Counts house The Professor had his ready and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said They never leave me and they shall not till this unhappy business is over Be wise also my friends It is no common enemy that we deal with Alas alas that that dear Madam Mina should suffer He stopped his voice was breaking and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart Outside the Harkers door we paused Art and Quincey held back and the latter said Should we disturb her We must said Van Helsing grimly If the door be locked I shall break it in May it not frighten her terribly It is unusual to break into a ladys room Van Helsing said solemnly You are always right but this is life and death All chambers are alike to the doctor and even were they not they are all as one to me tonight Friend John when I turn the handle if the door does not open do you put your shoulder down and shove and you too my friends Now He turned the handle as he spoke but the door did not yield We threw ourselves against it with a crash it burst open and we almost fell headlong into the room The Professor did actually fall and I saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees What I saw appalled me I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck and my heart seemed to stand still The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the whiteclad figure of his wife By her side stood a tall thin man clad in black His face was turned from us but the instant we saw we all recognised the Countin every way even to the scar on his forehead With his left hand he held both Mrs Harkers hands keeping them away with her arms at full tension his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck forcing her face down on his bosom Her white nightdress was smeared with blood and a thin stream trickled down the mans bare breast which was shown by his tornopen dress The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kittens nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink As we burst into the room the Count turned his face and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it His eyes flamed red with devilish passion the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge and the white sharp teeth behind the full lips of the blooddripping mouth champed together like those of a wild beast With a wrench which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height he turned and sprang at us But by this time the Professor had gained his feet and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer The Count suddenly stopped just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb and cowered back Further and further back he cowered as we lifting our crucifixes advanced The moonlight suddenly failed as a great black cloud sailed across the sky and when the gaslight sprang up under Quinceys match we saw nothing but a faint vapour This as we looked trailed under the door which with the recoil from its bursting open had swung back to its old position Van Helsing Art and I moved forward to Mrs Harker who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild so earpiercing so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray Her face was ghastly with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood her eyes were mad with terror Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Counts terrible grip and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body whilst Art after looking at her face for an instant despairingly ran out of the room Van Helsing whispered to me Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers herself I must wake him He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heartbreaking to hear I raised the blind and looked out of the window There was much moonshine and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yewtree It puzzled me to think why he was doing this but at the instant I heard Harkers quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness and turned to the bed On his face as there might well be was a look of wild amazement He seemed dazed for a few seconds and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once and he started up His wife was aroused by the quick movement and turned to him with her arms stretched out as though to embrace him instantly however she drew them in again and putting her elbows together held her hands before her face and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook In Gods name what does this mean Harker cried out Dr Seward Dr Van Helsing what is it What has happened What is wrong Mina dear what is it What does that blood mean My God my God has it come to this and raising himself to his knees he beat his hands wildly together Good God help us help her oh help her With a quick movement he jumped from bed and began to pull on his clothesall the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion What has happened Tell me all about it he cried without pausing Dr Van Helsing you love Mina I know Oh do something to save her It cannot have gone too far yet Guard her while I look for him His wife through her terror and horror and distress saw some sure danger to him instantly forgetting her own grief she seized hold of him and cried out No no Jonathan you must not leave me I have suffered enough tonight God knows without the dread of his harming you You must stay with me Stay with these friends who will watch over you Her expression became frantic as she spoke and he yielding to her she pulled him down sitting on the bed side and clung to him fiercely Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both The Professor held up his little golden crucifix and said with wonderful calmness Do not fear my dear We are here and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach You are safe for tonight and we must be calm and take counsel together She shuddered and was silent holding down her head on her husbands breast When she raised it his white nightrobe was stained with blood where her lips had touched and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops The instant she saw it she drew back with a low wail and whispered amidst choking sobs Unclean unclean I must touch him or kiss him no more Oh that it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy and whom he may have most cause to fear To this he spoke out resolutely Nonsense Mina It is a shame to me to hear such a word I would not hear it of you and I shall not hear it from you May God judge me by my deserts and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us He put out his arms and folded her to his breast and for a while she lay there sobbing He looked at us over her bowed head with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils his mouth was set as steel After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint and then he said to me speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost And now Dr Seward tell me all about it Too well I know the broad fact tell me all that has been I told him exactly what had happened and he listened with seeming impassiveness but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position with her mouth to the open wound in his breast It interested me even at that moment to see that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair Just as I had finished Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door They entered in obedience to our summons Van Helsing looked at me questioningly I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done To which Lord Godalming answered I could not see him anywhere in the passage or in any of our rooms I looked in the study but though he had been there he had gone He had however He stopped suddenly looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed Van Helsing said gravely Go on friend Arthur We want here no more concealments Our hope now is in knowing all Tell freely So Art went on He had been there and though it could only have been for a few seconds he made rare hay of the place All the manuscript had been burned and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire and the wax had helped the flames Here I interrupted Thank God there is the other copy in the safe His face lit for a moment but fell again as he went on I ran downstairs then but could see no sign of him I looked into Renfields room but there was no trace there except Again he paused Go on said Harker hoarsely so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue added except that the poor fellow is dead Mrs Harker raised her head looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly Gods will be done I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something but as I took it that it was with a purpose I said nothing Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked And you friend Quincey have you any to tell A little he answered It may be much eventually but at present I cant say I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would go when he left the house I did not see him but I saw a bat rise from Renfields window and flap westward I expected to see him in some shape go back to Carfax but he evidently sought some other lair He will not be back tonight for the sky is reddening in the east and the dawn is close We must work tomorrow He said the latter words through his shut teeth For a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence and I could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating then Van Helsing said placing his hand very tenderly on Mrs Harkers head And now Madam Minapoor dear dear Madam Minatell us exactly what happened God knows that I do not want that you be pained but it is need that we know all For now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp and in deadly earnest The day is close to us that must end all if it may be so and now is the chance that we may live and learn The poor dear lady shivered and I could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast Then she raised her head proudly and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his and after stooping and kissing it reverently held it fast The other hand was locked in that of her husband who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts she began I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me but for a long time it did not act I seemed to become more wakeful and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mindall of them connected with death and vampires with blood and pain and trouble Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly Do not fret dear You must be brave and strong and help me through the horrible task If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all you would understand how much I need your help Well I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will if it was to do me any good so I resolutely set myself to sleep Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me for I remember no more Jonathan coming in had not waked me for he lay by my side when next I remember There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed But I forget now if you know of this you will find it in my diary which I shall show you later I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence I turned to wake Jonathan but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught and not I I tried but I could not wake him This caused me a great fear and I looked around terrified Then indeed my heart sank within me beside the bed as if he had stepped out of the mistor rather as if the mist had turned into his figure for it had entirely disappearedstood a tall thin man all in black I knew him at once from the description of the others The waxen face the high aquiline nose on which the light fell in a thin white line the parted red lips with the sharp white teeth showing between and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St Marys Church at Whitby I knew too the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him For an instant my heart stood still and I would have screamed out only that I was paralysed In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen cutting whisper pointing as he spoke to Jonathan Silence If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything With a mocking smile he placed one hand upon my shoulder and holding me tight bared my throat with the other saying as he did so First a little refreshment to reward my exertions You may as well be quiet it is not the first time or the second that your veins have appeased my thirst I was bewildered and strangely enough I did not want to hinder him I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is when his touch is on his victim And oh my God my God pity me He placed his reeking lips upon my throat Her husband groaned again She clasped his hand harder and looked at him pityingly as if he were the injured one and went on I felt my strength fading away and I was in a half swoon How long this horrible thing lasted I know not but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul awful sneering mouth away I saw it drip with the fresh blood The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husbands sustaining arm With a great effort she recovered herself and went on Then he spoke to me mockingly And so you like the others would play your brains against mine You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs You know now and they know in part already and will know in full before long what it is to cross my path They should have kept their energies for use closer to home Whilst they played wits against meagainst me who commanded nations and intrigued for them and fought for them hundreds of years before they were bornI was countermining them And you their best beloved one are now to me flesh of my flesh blood of my blood kin of my kin my bountiful winepress for a while and shall be later on my companion and my helper You shall be avenged in turn for not one of them but shall minister to your needs But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done You have aided in thwarting me now you shall come to my call When my brain says Come to you you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding and to that end this With that he pulled open his shirt and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast When the blood began to spurt out he took my hands in one of his holding them tight and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the Oh my God my God what have I done What have I done to deserve such a fate I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days God pity me Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear Then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution As she was telling her terrible story the eastern sky began to quicken and everything became more and more clear Harker was still and quiet but over his face as the awful narrative went on came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action Of this I am sure the sun rises today on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course CHAPTER XXII JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNAL 3 OctoberAs I must do something or go mad I write this diary It is now six oclock and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat for Dr Van Helsing and Dr Seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best Our best will be God knows required today I must keep writing at every chance for I dare not stop to think All big and little must go down perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most The teaching big or little could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are today However we must trust and hope Poor Mina told me just now with the tears running down her dear cheeks that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is testedthat we must keep on trusting and that God will aid us up to the end The end oh my God what end To work To work When Dr Van Helsing and Dr Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield we went gravely into what was to be done First Dr Seward told us that when he and Dr Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor all in a heap His face was all bruised and crushed in and the bones of the neck were broken Dr Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything He said that he had been sitting downhe confessed to half dozingwhen he heard loud voices in the room and then Renfield had called out loudly several times God God God after that there was a sound of falling and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor face down just as the doctors had seen him Van Helsing asked if he had heard voices or a voice and he said he could not say that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one He could swear to it if required that the word God was spoken by the patient Dr Seward said to us when we were alone that he did not wish to go into the matter the question of an inquest had to be considered and it would never do to put forward the truth as no one would believe it As it was he thought that on the attendants evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed In case the coroner should demand it there would be a formal inquest necessarily to the same result When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full confidence that nothing of any sortno matter how painfulshould be kept from her She herself agreed as to its wisdom and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful and in such a depth of despair There must be no concealment she said Alas we have had too much already And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already enduredthan I suffer now Whatever may happen it must be of new hope or of new courage to me Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke and said suddenly but quietly But dear Madam Mina are you not afraid not for yourself but for others from yourself after what has happened Her face grew set in its lines but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered Ah no for my mind is made up To what he asked gently whilst we were all very still for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant Her answer came with direct simplicity as though she were simply stating a fact Because if I find in myselfand I shall watch keenly for ita sign of harm to any that I love I shall die You would not kill yourself he asked hoarsely I would if there were no friend who loved me who would save me such a pain and so desperate an effort She looked at him meaningly as she spoke He was sitting down but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly My child there is such an one if it were for your good For myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you even at this moment if it were best Nay were it safe But my child For a moment he seemed choked and a great sob rose in his throat he gulped it down and went on There are here some who would stand between you and death You must not die You must not die by any hand but least of all by your own Until the other who has fouled your sweet life is true dead you must not die for if he is still with the quick UnDead your death would make you even as he is No you must live You must struggle and strive to live though death would seem a boon unspeakable You must fight Death himself though he come to you in pain or in joy by the day or the night in safety or in peril On your living soul I charge you that you do not dienay nor think of deathtill this great evil be past The poor dear grew white as death and shock and shivered as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide We were all silent we could do nothing At length she grew more calm and turning to him said sweetly but oh so sorrowfully as she held out her hand I promise you my dear friend that if God will let me live I shall strive to do so till if it may be in His good time this horror may have passed away from me She was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her and we began to discuss what we were to do I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use and was to keep the record as she had done before She was pleased with the prospect of anything to doif pleased could be used in connection with so grim an interest As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work It is perhaps well he said that at our meeting after our visit to Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earthboxes that lay there Had we done so the Count must have guessed our purpose and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others but now he does not know our intentions Nay more in all probability he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs so that he cannot use them as of old We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that when we have examined the house in Piccadilly we may track the very last of them Today then is ours and in it rests our hope The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course Until it sets tonight that monster must retain whatever form he now has He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies If he go through a doorway he must open the door like a mortal And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them So we shall if we have not yet catch him and destroy him drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be in time sure Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Minas life and happiness were flying from us since whilst we talked action was impossible But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly Nay friend Jonathan he said in this the quickest way home is the longest way so your proverb say We shall all act and act with desperate quick when the time has come But think in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly The Count may have many houses which he has bought Of them he will have deeds of purchase keys and other things He will have paper that he write on he will have his book of cheques There are many belongings that he must have somewhere why not in this place so central so quiet where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice We shall go there and search that house and when we learn what it holds then we do what our friend Arthur call in his phrases of hunt stop the earths and so we run down our old foxso is it not Then let us come at once I cried we are wasting the precious precious time The Professor did not move but simply said And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly Any way I cried We shall break in if need be And your police where will they be and what will they say I was staggered but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it So I said as quietly as I could Dont wait more than need be you know I am sure what torture I am in Ah my child that I do and indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish But just think what can we do until all the world be at movement Then will come our time I have thought and thought and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all Now we wish to get into the house but we have no key is it not so I nodded Now suppose that you were in truth the owner of that house and could not still get in and think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker what would you do I should get a respectable locksmith and set him to work to pick the lock for me And your police they would interfere would they not Oh no not if they knew the man was properly employed Then he looked at me as keenly as he spoke all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer and the belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one Your police must indeed be zealous men and cleveroh so cleverin reading the heart that they trouble themselves in such matter No no my friend Jonathan you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your London or of any city in the world and if you do it as such things are rightly done and at the time such things are rightly done no one will interfere I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house some burglar came and broke window at back and got in Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door before the very eyes of the police Then he have an auction in that house and advertise it and put up big notice and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them Then he go to a builder and he sell him that house making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time And your police and other authority help him all they can And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been This was all done en rgle and in our work we shall be en rgle too We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of shall deem it strange but we shall go after ten oclock when there are many about and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Minas face became relaxed a thought there was hope in such good counsel Van Helsing went on When once within that house we may find more clues at any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earthboxesat Bermondsey and Mile End Lord Godalming stood up I can be of some use here he said I shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient Look here old fellow said Morris it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking but dont you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to Friend Quincey is right said the Professor His head is what you call in plane with the horizon It is a difficult thing that we go to do and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night She was very very palealmost ghastly and so thin that her lips were drawn away showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence I did not mention this last lest it should give her needless pain but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper but the time as yet was short and there was time for fear When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces there were new sources of doubt It was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the Counts lair close at hand In case he should find it out too soon we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction and his presence in his purely material shape and at his weakest might give us some new clue As to the disposal of forces it was suggested by the Professor that after our visit to Carfax we should all enter the house in Piccadilly that the two doctors and I should remain there whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them It was possible if not likely the Professor urged that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there At any rate we might be able to follow him in force To this plan I strenuously objected and so far as my going was concerned for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina I thought that my mind was made up on the subject but Mina would not listen to my objection She said that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful that amongst the Counts papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania and that as it was all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Counts extraordinary power I had to give in for Minas resolution was fixed she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together As for me she said I have no fear Things have been as bad as they can be and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort Go my husband God can if He wishes it guard me as well alone as with any one present So I started up crying out Then in Gods name let us come at once for we are losing time The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we think Not so said Van Helsing holding up his hand But why I asked Do you forget he said with actually a smile that last night he banqueted heavily and will sleep late Did I forget shall I evercan I ever Can any of us ever forget that terrible scene Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face and shuddered whilst she moaned Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience He had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort When it struck him what he said he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her Oh Madam Mina he said dear dear Madam Mina alas that I of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so but you will forget it will you not He bent low beside her as he spoke she took his hand and looking at him through her tears said hoarsely No I shall not forget for it is well that I remember and with it I have so much in memory of you that is sweet that I take it all together Now you must all be going soon Breakfast is ready and we must all eat that we may be strong Breakfast was a strange meal to us all We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us When it was over Van Helsing stood up and said Now my dear friends we go forth to our terrible enterprise Are we all armed as we were on that night when first we visited our enemys lair armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack We all assured him Then it is well Now Madam Mina you are in any case quite safe here until the sunset and before then we shall returnif We shall return But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack I have myself since you came down prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know so that He may not enter Now let me guard yourself On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father the Son and There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear As he had placed the Wafer on Minas forehead it had seared ithad burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of whitehot metal My poor darlings brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream But the words to her thought came quickly the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement Pulling her beautiful hair over her face as the leper of old his mantle she wailed out Unclean Unclean Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day They all paused I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief and putting my arms around held her tight For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired and was stating things outside himself It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit as He most surely shall on the Judgment Day to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon And oh Madam Mina my dear my dear may we who love you be there to see when that red scar the sign of Gods knowledge of what has been shall pass away and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know For so surely as we live that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us Till then we bear our Cross as His Son did in obedience to His Will It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes and shame through tears and blood through doubts and fears and all that makes the difference between God and man There was hope in his words and comfort and they made for resignation Mina and I both felt so and simultaneously we each took one of the old mans hands and bent over and kissed it Then without a word we all knelt down together and all holding hands swore to be true to each other We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom each in his own way we loved and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us It was then time to start So I said farewell to Mina a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day and we set out To one thing I have made up my mind if we find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew Had not our minds been made up and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on we could hardly have proceeded with our task We found no papers or any sign of use in the house and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last Dr Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them And now my friends we have a duty here to do We must sterilise this earth so sacred of holy memories that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use He has chosen this earth because it has been holy Thus we defeat him with his own weapon for we make it more holy still It was sanctified to such use of man now we sanctify it to God As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open The earth smelled musty and close but we did not somehow seem to mind for our attention was concentrated on the Professor Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home we aiding him as he worked One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes and left them as we had found them to all appearance but in each was a portion of the Host When we closed the door behind us the Professor said solemnly So much is already done If it may be that with all the others we can be so successful then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam Minas forehead all white as ivory and with no stain As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum I looked eagerly and in the window of my own room saw Mina I waved my hand to her and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished She nodded in reply to show that she understood The last I saw she was waving her hand in farewell It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train which was steaming in as we reached the platform I have written this in the train      Piccadilly 1230 oclockJust before we reached Fenchurch Street Lord Godalming said to me Quincey and I will find a locksmith You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty for under the circumstances it wouldnt seem so bad for us to break into an empty house But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium but he went on Besides it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us My title will make it all right with the locksmith and with any policeman that may come along You had better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park somewhere in sight of the house and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away do you all come across We shall be on the lookout for you and shall let you in The advice is good said Van Helsing so we said no more Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab we following in another At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green Park My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and sprucelooking neighbours We sat down on a bench within good view and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others At length we saw a fourwheeler drive up Out of it in leisurely fashion got Lord Godalming and Morris and down from the box descended a thickset working man with his rushwoven basket of tools Morris paid the cabman who touched his hat and drove away Together the two ascended the steps and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along The policeman nodded acquiescence and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him After searching through it he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion Then he stood up looked into the keyhole blew into it and turning to his employers made some remark Lord Godalming smiled and the man lifted a goodsized bunch of keys selecting one of them he began to probe the lock as if feeling his way with it After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second and then a third All at once the door opened under a slight push from him and he and the two others entered the hall We sat still my own cigar burnt furiously but Van Helsings went cold altogether We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag Then he held the door partly open steadying it with his knees whilst he fitted a key to the lock This he finally handed to Lord Godalming who took out his purse and gave him something The man touched his hat took his bag put on his coat and departed not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction When the man had fairly gone we three crossed the street and knocked at the door It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar The place smells so vilely said the latter as we came in It did indeed smell vilelylike the old chapel at Carfaxand with our previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the place pretty freely We moved to explore the house all keeping together in case of attack for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the house In the diningroom which lay at the back of the hall we found eight boxes of earth Eight boxes only out of the nine which we sought Our work was not over and would never be until we should have found the missing box First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stoneflagged yard at the blank face of a stable pointed to look like the front of a miniature house There were no windows in it so we were not afraid of being overlooked We did not lose any time in examining the chests With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them one by one and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house and we proceeded to search for any of his effects After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms from basement to attic we came to the conclusion that the diningroom contained any effects which might belong to the Count and so we proceeded to minutely examine them They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great diningroom table There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey notepaper envelopes and pens and ink All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust There were also a clothes brush a brush and comb and a jug and basinthe latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes probably those belonging to the other houses When we had examined this last find Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South took with them the keys in a great bunch and set out to destroy the boxes in these places The rest of us are with what patience we can waiting their returnor the coming of the Count CHAPTER XXIII DR SEWARDS DIARY 3 OctoberThe time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time I could see his beneficent purpose by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see Last night he was a frank happylooking man with strong youthful face full of energy and with dark brown hair Today he is a drawn haggard old man whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and griefwritten lines of his face His energy is still intact in fact he is like a living flame This may yet be his salvation for if all go well it will tide him over the despairing period he will then in a kind of way wake again to the realities of life Poor fellow I thought my own trouble was bad enough but his The Professor knows this well enough and is doing his best to keep his mind active What he has been saying was under the circumstances of absorbing interest So well as I can remember here it is I have studied over and over again since they came into my hands all the papers relating to this monster and the more I have studied the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out All through there are signs of his advance not only of his power but of his knowledge of it As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of BudaPesth he was in life a most wonderful man Soldier statesman and alchemistwhich latter was the highest development of the scienceknowledge of his time He had a mighty brain a learning beyond compare and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse He dared even to attend the Scholomance and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay Well in him the brain powers survived the physical death though it would seem that memory was not all complete In some faculties of mind he has been and is only a child but he is growing and some things that were childish at the first are now of mans stature He is experimenting and doing it well and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yethe may be yet if we failthe father or furtherer of a new order of beings whose road must lead through Death not Life Harker groaned and said And this is all arrayed against my darling But how is he experimenting The knowledge may help us to defeat him He has all along since his coming been trying his power slowly but surely that big childbrain of his is working Well for us it is as yet a childbrain for had he dared at the first to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power However he means to succeed and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow Festina lente may well be his motto I fail to understand said Harker wearily Oh do be more plain to me Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke Ah my child I will be plain Do you not see how of late this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally How he has been making use of the zophagous patient to effect his entry into friend Johns home for your Vampire though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate But these are not his most important experiments Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others He knew not then but that must be so But all the time that so great childbrain of his was growing and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box So he began to help and then when he found that this be allright he try to move them all alone And so he progress and he scatter these graves of him and none but he know where they are hidden He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground So that he only use them in the night or at such time as he can change his form they do him equal well and none may know these are his hidingplace But my child do not despair this knowledge come to him just too late Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him and before the sunset this shall be so Then he have no place where he can move and hide I delayed this morning that so we might be sure Is there not more at stake for us than for him Then why we not be even more careful than him By my clock it is one hour and already if all be well friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us Today is our day and we must go sure if slow and lose no chance See there are five of us when those absent ones return Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door the double postmans knock of the telegraph boy We all moved out to the hall with one impulse and Van Helsing holding up his hand to us to keep silence stepped to the door and opened it The boy handed in a despatch The Professor closed the door again and after looking at the direction opened it and read aloud Look out for D He has just now 1245 come from Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South He seems to be going the round and may want to see you Mina There was a pause broken by Jonathan Harkers voice Now God be thanked we shall soon meet Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said God will act in His own way and time Do not fear and do not rejoice as yet for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings I care for nothing now he answered hotly except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation I would sell my soul to do it Oh hush hush my child said Van Helsing God does not purchase souls in this wise and the Devil though he may purchase does not keep faith But God is merciful and just and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear Madam Mina Think you how her pain would be doubled did she but hear your wild words Do not fear any of us we are all devoted to this cause and today shall see the end The time is coming for action today this Vampire is limit to the powers of man and till sunset he may not change It will take him time to arrive heresee it is twenty minutes past oneand there are yet some times before he can hither come be he never so quick What we must hope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first About half an hour after we had received Mrs Harkers telegram there came a quiet resolute knock at the hall door It was just an ordinary knock such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen but it made the Professors heart and mine beat loudly We looked at each other and together moved out into the hall we each held ready to use our various armamentsthe spiritual in the left hand the mortal in the right Van Helsing pulled back the latch and holding the door half open stood back having both hands ready for action The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step close to the door we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris They came quickly in and closed the door behind them the former saying as they moved along the hall It is all right We found both places six boxes in each and we destroyed them all Destroyed asked the Professor For him We were silent for a minute and then Quincey said Theres nothing to do but to wait here If however he doesnt turn up by five oclock we must start off for it wont do to leave Mrs Harker alone after sunset He will be here before long now said Van Helsing who had been consulting his pocketbook Nota bene in Madams telegram he went south from Carfax that means he went to cross the river and he could only do so at slack of tide which should be something before one oclock That he went south has a meaning for us He is as yet only suspicious and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next This took him some time for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way Believe me my friends we shall not have long to wait now We should have ready some plan of attack so that we may throw away no chance Hush there is no time now Have all your arms Be ready He held up a warning hand as he spoke for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door I could not but admire even at such a moment the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly Now the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively With a swift glance around the room he at once laid out our plan of attack and without speaking a word with a gesture placed us each in position Van Helsing Harker and I were just behind the door so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness The slow careful steps came along the hall the Count was evidently prepared for some surpriseat least he feared it Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him There was something so pantherlike in the movementsomething so unhuman that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming The first to act was Harker who with a quick movement threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house As the Count saw us a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face showing the eyeteeth long and pointed but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lionlike disdain His expression again changed as with a single impulse we all advanced upon him It was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything Harker evidently meant to try the matter for he had ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him The blow was a powerful one only the diabolical quickness of the Counts leap back saved him A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart As it was the point just cut the cloth of his coat making a wide gap whence a bundle of banknotes and a stream of gold fell out The expression of the Counts face was so hellish that for a moment I feared for Harker though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand I felt a mighty power fly along my arm and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignityof anger and hellish ragewhich came over the Counts face His waxen hue became greenishyellow by the contrast of his burning eyes and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound The next instant with a sinuous dive he swept under Harkers arm ere his blow could fall and grasping a handful of the money from the floor dashed across the room threw himself at the window Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass he tumbled into the flagged area below Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the ting of the gold as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground He rushing up the steps crossed the flagged yard and pushed open the stable door There he turned and spoke to us You think to baffle me youwith your pale faces all in a row like sheep in a butchers You shall be sorry yet each one of you You think you have left me without a place to rest but I have more My revenge is just begun I spread it over centuries and time is on my side Your girls that you all love are mine already and through them you and others shall yet be minemy creatures to do my bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed Bah With a contemptuous sneer he passed quickly through the door and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him A door beyond opened and shut The first of us to speak was the Professor as realising the difficulty of following him through the stable we moved toward the hall We have learnt somethingmuch Notwithstanding his brave words he fears us he fear time he fear want For if not why he hurry so His very tone betray him or my ears deceive Why take that money You follow quick You are hunters of wild beast and understand it so For me I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him if so that he return As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket took the titledeeds in the bundle as Harker had left them and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace where he set fire to them with a match Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard and Harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the Count He had however bolted the stable door and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart It was now late in the afternoon and sunset was not far off We had to recognise that our game was up with heavy hearts we agreed with the Professor when he said Let us go back to Madam Minapoor poor dear Madam Mina All we can do just now is done and we can there at least protect her But we need not despair There is but one more earthbox and we must try to find it when that is done all may yet be well I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker The poor fellow was quite broken down now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppresshe was thinking of his wife With sad hearts we came back to my house where we found Mrs Harker waiting us with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness When she saw our faces her own became as pale as death for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer and then she said cheerfully I can never thank you all enough Oh my poor darling As she spoke she took her husbands grey head in her hands and kissed itLay your poor head here and rest it All will yet be well dear God will protect us if He so will it in His good intent The poor fellow groaned There was no place for words in his sublime misery We had a sort of perfunctory supper together and I think it cheered us all up somewhat It was perhaps the mere animal heat of food to hungry peoplefor none of us had eaten anything since breakfastor the sense of companionship may have helped us but anyhow we were all less miserable and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope True to our promise we told Mrs Harker everything which had passed and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested she listened bravely and with calmness When we came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly she clung to her husbands arm and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come She said nothing however till the narration was all done and matters had been brought right up to the present time Then without letting go her husbands hand she stood up amongst us and spoke Oh that I could give any idea of the scene of that sweet sweet good good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation with the red scar on her forehead of which she was conscious and which we saw with grinding of our teethremembering whence and how it came her loving kindness against our grim hate her tender faith against all our fears and doubting and we knowing that so far as symbols went she with all her goodness and purity and faith was outcast from God Jonathan she said and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness Jonathan dear and you all my true true friends I want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time I know that you must fightthat you must destroy even as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter but it is not a work of hate That poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all Just think what will be his joy when he too is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality You must be pitiful to him too though it may not hold your hands from his destruction As she spoke I could see her husbands face darken and draw together as though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core Instinctively the clasp on his wifes hand grew closer till his knuckles looked white She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at If beyond it I could send his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it Oh hush oh hush in the name of the good God Dont say such things Jonathan my husband or you will crush me with fear and horror Just think my dearI have been thinking all this long long day of itthat  perhaps  some day  I too may need such pity and that some other like youand with equal cause for angermay deny it to me Oh my husband my husband indeed I would have spared you such a thought had there been another way but I pray that God may not have treasured your wild words except as the heartbroken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man Oh God let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered who all his life has done no wrong and on whom so many sorrows have come We men were all in tears now There was no resisting them and we wept openly She wept too to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her and putting his arms round her hid his face in the folds of her dress Van Helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room leaving the two loving hearts alone with their God Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming of the Vampire and assured Mrs Harker that she might rest in peace She tried to school herself to the belief and manifestly for her husbands sake tried to seem content It was a brave struggle and was I think and believe not without its reward Van Helsing had placed at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency When they had retired Quincey Godalming and I arranged that we should sit up dividing the night between us and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady The first watch falls to Quincey so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can Godalming has already turned in for his is the second watch Now that my work is done I too shall go to bed Jonathan Harkers Journal 34 October close to midnightI thought yesterday would never end There was over me a yearning for sleep in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed and that any change must now be for the better Before we parted we discussed what our next step was to be but we could arrive at no result All we knew was that one earthbox remained and that the Count alone knew where it was If he chooses to lie hidden he may baffle us for years and in the meantimethe thought is too horrible I dare not think of it even now This I know that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection that one is my poor wronged darling I love her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature This is hope to me We are all drifting reefwards now and faith is our only anchor Thank God Mina is sleeping and sleeping without dreams I fear what her dreams might be like with such terrible memories to ground them in She has not been so calm within my seeing since the sunset Then for a while there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning I am not sleepy myself though I am wearyweary to death However I must try to sleep for there is tomorrow to think of and there is no rest for me until      LaterI must have fallen asleep for I was awaked by Mina who was sitting up in bed with a startled look on her face I could see easily for we did not leave the room in darkness she had placed a warning hand over my mouth and now she whispered in my ear Hush there is someone in the corridor I got up softly and crossing the room gently opened the door Just outside stretched on a mattress lay Mr Morris wide awake He raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me Hush go back to bed it is all right One of us will be here all night We dont mean to take any chances His look and gesture forbade discussion so I came back and told Mina She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly Oh thank God for good brave men With a sigh she sank back again to sleep I write this now as I am not sleepy though I must try again      4 October morningOnce again during the night I was wakened by Mina This time we had all had a good sleep for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light She said to me hurriedly Go call the Professor I want to see him at once Why I asked I have an idea I suppose it must have come in the night and matured without my knowing it He must hypnotise me before the dawn and then I shall be able to speak Go quick dearest the time is getting close I went to the door Dr Seward was resting on the mattress and seeing me he sprang to his feet Is anything wrong he asked in alarm No I replied but Mina wants to see Dr Van Helsing at once I will go he said and hurried into the Professors room In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressinggown and Mr Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr Seward at the door asking questions When the Professor saw Mina smilea positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face he rubbed his hands as he said Oh my dear Madam Mina this is indeed a change See friend Jonathan we have got our dear Madam Mina as of old back to us today Then turning to her he said cheerfully And what am I do for you For at this hour you do not want me for nothings I want you to hypnotise me she said Do it before the dawn for I feel that then I can speak and speak freely Be quick for the time is short Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed Looking fixedly at her he commenced to make passes in front of her from over the top of her head downward with each hand in turn Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer for I felt that some crisis was at hand Gradually her eyes closed and she sat stock still only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped and I could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration Mina opened her eyes but she did not seem the same woman There was a faraway look in her eyes and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me Raising his hand to impose silence the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in They came on tiptoe closing the door behind them and stood at the foot of the bed looking on Mina appeared not to see them The stillness was broken by Van Helsings voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts Where are you The answer came in a neutral way I do not know Sleep has no place it can call its own For several minutes there was silence Mina sat rigid and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly the rest of us hardly dared to breathe The room was growing lighter without taking his eyes from Minas face Dr Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind I did so and the day seemed just upon us A red streak shot up and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room On the instant the Professor spoke again Where are you now The answer came dreamily but with intention it were as though she were interpreting something I have heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes I do not know It is all strange to me What do you see I can see nothing it is all dark What do you hear I could detect the strain in the Professors patient voice The lapping of water It is gurgling by and little waves leap I can hear them on the outside Then you are on a ship We all looked at each other trying to glean something each from the other We were afraid to think The answer came quick Oh yes What else do you hear The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about There is the creaking of a chain and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the rachet What are you doing I am stilloh so still It is like death The voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping and the open eyes closed again By this time the sun had risen and we were all in the full light of day Dr Van Helsing placed his hands on Minas shoulders and laid her head down softly on her pillow She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments and then with a long sigh awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her Have I been talking in my sleep was all she said She seemed however to know the situation without telling though she was eager to know what she had told The Professor repeated the conversation and she said Then there is not a moment to lose it may not be yet too late Mr Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professors calm voice called them back Stay my friends That ship wherever it was was weighing anchor whilst she spoke There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in your so great Port of London Which of them is it that you seek God be thanked that we have once again a clue though whither it may lead us we know not We have been blind somewhat blind after the manner of men since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen Alas but that sentence is a puddle is it not We can know now what was in the Counts mind when he seize that money though Jonathans so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread He meant escape Hear me ESCAPE He saw that with but one earthbox left and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox this London was no place for him He have take his last earthbox on board a ship and he leave the land He think to escape but no we follow him Tally Ho as friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock Our old fox is wily oh so wily and we must follow with wile I too am wily and I think his mind in a little while In meantime we may rest and in peace for there are waters between us which he do not want to pass and which he could not if he wouldunless the ship were to touch the land and then only at full or slack tide See and the sun is just rose and all day to sunset is to us Let us take bath and dress and have breakfast which we all need and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked But why need we seek him further when he is gone away from us He took her hand and patted it as he replied Ask me nothings as yet When we have breakfast then I answer all questions He would say no more and we separated to dress After breakfast Mina repeated her question He looked at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully Because my dear dear Madam Mina now more than ever must we find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell She grew paler as she asked faintly Why Because he answered solemnly he can live for centuries and you are but mortal woman Time is now to be dreadedsince once he put that mark upon your throat I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint CHAPTER XXIV DR SEWARDS PHONOGRAPH DIARY SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING This to Jonathan Harker You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina We shall go to make our searchif I can call it so for it is not search but knowing and we seek confirmation only But do you stay and take care of her today This is your best and most holiest office This day nothing can find him here Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already for I have tell them He our enemy have gone away he have gone back to his Castle in Transylvania I know it so well as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall He have prepare for this in some way and that last earthbox was ready to ship somewheres For this he took the money for this he hurry at the last lest we catch him before the sun go down It was his last hope save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy being as he thought like him keep open to him But there was not of time When that fail he make straight for his last resourcehis last earthwork I might say did I wish double entente He is clever oh so clever he know that his game here was finish and so he decide he go back home He find ship going by the route he came and he go in it We go off now to find what ship and whither bound when we have discover that we come back and tell you all Then we will comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope For it will be hope when you think it over that all is not lost This very creature that we pursue he take hundreds of years to get so far as London and yet in one day when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out He is finite though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do But we are strong each in our purpose and we are all more strong together Take heart afresh dear husband of Madam Mina This battle is but begun and in the end we shall winso sure as that God sits on high to watch over His children Therefore be of much comfort till we return VAN HELSING Jonathan Harkers Journal 4 OctoberWhen I read to Mina Van Helsings message in the phonograph the poor girl brightened up considerably Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort and comfort is strength to her For my own part now that his horrible danger is not face to face with us it seems almost impossible to believe in it Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a longforgotten dream Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight Alas how can I disbelieve In the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darlings white forehead Whilst that lasts there can be no disbelief And afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear Mina and I fear to be idle so we have been over all the diaries again and again Somehow although the reality seems greater each time the pain and the fear seem less There is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout which is comforting Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good It may be I shall try to think as she does We have never spoken to each other yet of the future It is better to wait till we see the Professor and the others after their investigations The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run for me again It is now three oclock Mina Harkers Journal 5 October 5 p mOur meeting for report Present Professor Van Helsing Lord Godalming Dr Seward Mr Quincey Morris Jonathan Harker Mina Harker Dr Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth or by somewhere in the Black Sea since by that way he come It was a dreary blank that was before us Omne ignotum pro magnifico and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night He was in sailing ship since Madam Mina tell of sails being set These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times and so we go by suggestion of Lord Godalming to your Lloyds where are note of all ships that sail however so small There we find that only one BlackSeabound ship go out with the tide She is the Czarina Catherine and she sail from Doolittles Wharf for Varna and thence on to other parts and up the Danube Soh said I this is the ship whereon is the Count So off we go to Doolittles Wharf and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office From him we inquire of the goings of the Czarina Catherine He swear much and he red face and loud of voice but he good fellow all the same and when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing he still better fellow and humble servant to us He come with us and ask many men who are rough and hot these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty They say much of blood and bloom and of others which I comprehend not though I guess what they mean but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know They make known to us among them how last afternoon at about five oclock comes a man so hurry A tall man thin and pale with high nose and teeth so white and eyes that seem to be burning That he be all in black except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where Some took him to the office and then to the ship where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gangplank and ask that the captain come to him The captain come when told that he will be pay well and though he swear much at the first he agree to term Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired He go there and soon he come again himself driving cart on which a great box this he himself lift down though it take several to put it on truck for the ship He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be But he say no that he come not yet for that he have much to do Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quickwith bloodfor that his ship will leave the placeof bloodbefore the turn of the tidewith blood Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon The captain swear again polyglot and the thin man make him bow and thank him and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing Final the captain more red than ever and in more tongues tell him that he doesnt want no Frenchmenwith bloom upon them and also with bloodin his shipwith blood on her also And so after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms he departed No one knew where he went or bloomin well cared as they said for they had something else to think ofwell with blood again for it soon became apparent to all that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected A thin mist began to creep up from the river and it grew and grew till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her The captain swore polyglotvery polyglotpolyglot with bloom and blood but he could do nothing The water rose and rose and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether He was in no friendly mood when just at full tide the thin man came up the gangplank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed Then the captain replied that he wished that he and his boxold and with much bloom and bloodwere in hell But the thin man did not be offend and went down with the mate and saw where it was place and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog He must have come off by himself for none notice him Indeed they thought not of him for soon the fog begin to melt away and all was clear again My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed as they told how the captains swears exceeded even his usual polyglot and was more than ever full of picturesque when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all except where it lay round the wharf However the ship went out on the ebb tide and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth She was by then when they told us well out to sea And so my dear Madam Mina it is that we have to rest for a time for our enemy is on the sea with the fog at his command on his way to the Danube mouth To sail a ship takes time go she never so quick and when we start we go on land more quick and we meet him there Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset for then he can make no struggle and we may deal with him as we should There are days for us in which we can make ready our plan We know all about where he go for we have seen the owner of the ship who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be The box we seek is to be landed in Varna and to be given to an agent one Ristics who will there present his credentials and so our merchant friend will have done his part When he ask if there be any wrong for that so he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna we say no for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs It must be done by us alone and in our own way When Dr Van Helsing had done speaking I asked him if he were certain that the Count had remained on board the ship He replied We have the best proof of that your own evidence when in the hypnotic trance this morning I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the Count for oh I dread Jonathan leaving me and I know that he would surely go if the others went He answered in growing passion at first quietly As he went on however he grew more angry and more forceful till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men Yes it is necessarynecessarynecessary For your sake in the first and then for the sake of humanity This monster has done much harm already in the narrow scope where he find himself and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing All this have I told these others you my dear Madam Mina will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John or in that of your husband I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren landbarren of peoplesand coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn was the work of centuries Were another of the UnDead like him to try to do what he has done perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been or that will be could aid him With this one all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way The very place where he have been alive UnDead for all these centuries is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither There have been volcanoes some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties and gases that kill or make to vivify Doubtless there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way and in himself were from the first some great qualities In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve more subtle brain more braver heart than any man In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive so his brain grow too All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him for it have to yield to the powers that come from and are symbolic of good And now this is what he is to us He have infect youoh forgive me my dear that I must say such but it is for good of you that I speak He infect you in such wise that even if he do no more you have only to liveto live in your own old sweet way and so in time death which is of mans common lot and with Gods sanction shall make you like to him This must not be We have sworn together that it must not Thus are we ministers of Gods own wish that the world and men for whom His Son die will not be given over to monsters whose very existence would defame Him He have allowed us to redeem one soul already and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise and like them if we fall we fall in good cause He paused and I said But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely Since he has been driven from England will he not avoid it as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted Aha he said your simile of the tiger good for me and I shall adopt him Your maneater as they of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human care no more for the other prey but prowl unceasing till he get him This that we hunt from our village is a tiger too a maneater and he never cease to prowl Nay in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar In his life his living life he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground he be beaten back but did he stay No He come again and again and again Look at his persistence and endurance With the childbrain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city What does he do He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task He find in patience just how is his strength and what are his powers He study new tongues He learn new social life new environment of old ways the politic the law the finance the science the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was His glimpse that he have had whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire Nay it help him to grow as to his brain for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises He have done this alone all alone from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him He that can smile at death as we know him who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples Oh if such an one was to come from God and not the Devil what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours But we are pledged to set the world free Our toil must be in silence and our efforts all in secret for in this enlightened age when men believe not even what they see the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength It would be at once his sheath and his armour and his weapons to destroy us his enemies who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we lovefor the good of mankind and for the honour and glory of God After a general discussion it was determined that for tonight nothing be definitely settled that we should all sleep on the facts and try to think out the proper conclusions Tomorrow at breakfast we are to meet again and after making our conclusions known to one another we shall decide on some definite cause of action      I feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight It is as if some haunting presence were removed from me Perhaps  My surmise was not finished could not be for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead and I knew that I was still unclean Dr Sewards Diary 5 OctoberWe all rose early and I think that sleep did much for each and all of us When we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature Let any obstructing cause no matter what be removed in any wayeven by deathand we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment More than once as we sat around the table my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs Harkers forehead that I was brought back to reality Even now when I am gravely revolving the matter it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent Even Mrs Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells it is only now and again when something recalls it to her mind that she thinks of her terrible scar We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action I see only one immediate difficulty I know it by instinct rather than reason we shall all have to speak frankly and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs Harkers tongue is tied I know that she forms conclusions of her own and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be but she will not or cannot give them utterance I have mentioned this to Van Helsing and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called the Vampires baptism of blood Well there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything One thing I know that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs Harkers silences then there is a terrible difficultyan unknown dangerin the work before us The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech I dare not think further for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others I shall try to open the subject with him      LaterWhen the Professor came in we talked over the state of things I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject After beating about the bush a little he said suddenly Friend John there is something that you and I must talk of alone just at the first at any rate Later we may have to take the others into our confidence then he stopped so I waited he went on Madam Mina our poor dear Madam Mina is changing A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed Van Helsing continued With the sad experience of Miss Lucy we must this time be warned before things go too far Our task is now in reality more difficult than ever and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face It is now but very very slight but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge Her teeth are some sharper and at times her eyes are more hard But these are not all there is to her the silence now often as so it was with Miss Lucy She did not speak even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later Now my fear is this If it be that she can by our hypnotic trance tell what the Count see and hear is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his should if he will compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know I nodded acquiescence he went on Then what we must do is to prevent this we must keep her ignorant of our intent and so she cannot tell what she know not This is a painful task Oh so painful that it heartbreak me to think of but it must be When today we meet I must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council but be simply guarded by us He wiped his forehead which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured I knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt I told him and the effect was as I expected It is now close to the time of our general gathering Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting and his painful part of it I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone      LaterAt the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself Mrs Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us The Professor and I looked at each other for an instant and somehow we both seemed relieved For my own part I thought that if Mrs Harker realised the danger herself it was much pain as well as much danger averted Under the circumstances we agreed by a questioning look and answer with finger on lip to preserve silence in our suspicions until we should have been able to confer alone again We went at once into our Plan of Campaign Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first The Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna but we can travel overland to the same place in three days Now if we allow for two days less for the ships voyage owing to such weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us then we have a margin of nearly two weeks Thus in order to be quite safe we must leave here on 17th at latest Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives and able to make such preparations as may be necessary Of course we shall all go armedarmed against evil things spiritual as well as physical Here Quincey Morris added I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country and it may be that he shall get there before us I propose that we add Winchesters to our armament I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around Do you remember Art when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk What wouldnt we have given then for a repeater apiece Good said Van Helsing Winchesters it shall be Quinceys head is level at all times but most so when there is to hunt metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man In the meantime we can do nothing here and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us why not go there more soon It is as long to wait here as there Tonight and tomorrow we can get ready and then if all be well we four can set out on our journey We four said Harker interrogatively looking from one to another of us Of course answered the Professor quickly you must remain to take care of your so sweet wife Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice Let us talk of that part of it in the morning I want to consult with Mina I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her but he took no notice I looked at him significantly and coughed For answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away Jonathan Harkers Journal 5 October afternoonFor some time after our meeting this morning I could not think The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought Minas determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking and as I could not argue the matter with her I could only guess I am as far as ever from a solution now The way the others received it too puzzled me the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us Mina is sleeping now calmly and sweetly like a little child Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness Thank God there are such moments still for her      LaterHow strange it all is I sat watching Minas happy sleep and came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be As the evening drew on and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me All at once Mina opened her eyes and looking at me tenderly said Jonathan I want you to promise me something on your word of honour A promise made to me but made holily in Gods hearing and not to be broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears Quick you must make it to me at once Mina I said a promise like that I cannot make at once I may have no right to make it But dear one she said with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars it is I who wish it and it is not for myself You can ask Dr Van Helsing if I am not right if he disagrees you may do as you will Nay more if you all agree later you are absolved from the promise I promise I said and for a moment she looked supremely happy though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead She said Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count Not by word or inference or implication not at any time whilst this remains to me and she solemnly pointed to the scar I saw that she was in earnest and said solemnly I promise and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us      Later midnightMina has been bright and cheerful all the evening So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage as if infected somewhat with her gaiety as a result even I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted We all retired early Mina is now sleeping like a little child it is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble Thank God for it for then at least she can forget her care Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did tonight I shall try it Oh for a dreamless sleep      6 October morningAnother surprise Mina woke me early about the same time as yesterday and asked me to bring Dr Van Helsing I thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism and without question went for the Professor He had evidently expected some such call for I found him dressed in his room His door was ajar so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room He came at once as he passed into the room he asked Mina if the others might come too No she said quite simply it will not be necessary You can tell them just as well I must go with you on your journey Dr Van Helsing was as startled as I was After a moments pause he asked But why You must take me with you I am safer with you and you shall be safer too But why dear Madam Mina You know that your safety is our solemnest duty We go into danger to which you are or may be more liable than any of us fromfrom circumstancesthings that have been He paused embarrassed As she replied she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead I know That is why I must go I can tell you now whilst the sun is coming up I may not be able again I know that when the Count wills me I must go I know that if he tells me to come in secret I must come by wile by any device to hoodwinkeven Jonathan God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke and if there be indeed a Recording Angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour I could only clasp her hand I could not speak my emotion was too great for even the relief of tears She went on You men are brave and strong You are strong in your numbers for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone Besides I may be of service since you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even I myself do not know Dr Van Helsing said very gravely Madam Mina you are as always most wise You shall with us come and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve When he had spoken Minas long spell of silence made me look at her She had fallen back on her pillow asleep she did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly We went to his room and within a minute Lord Godalming Dr Seward and Mr Morris were with us also He told them what Mina had said and went on In the morning we shall leave for Varna We have now to deal with a new factor Madam Mina Oh but her soul is true It is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done but it is most right and we are warned in time There must be no chance lost and in Varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives What shall we do exactly asked Mr Morris laconically The Professor paused before replying We shall at the first board that ship then when we have identified the box we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it This we shall fasten for when it is there none can emerge so at least says the superstition And to superstition must we trust at the first it was mans faith in the early and it have its root in faith still Then when we get the opportunity that we seek when none are near to see we shall open the box andand all will be well I shall not wait for any opportunity said Morris When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster though there were a thousand men looking on and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel I think he understood my look I hope he did Good boy said Dr Van Helsing Brave boy Quincey is all man God bless him for it My child believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear I do but say what we may dowhat we must do But indeed indeed we cannot say what we shall do There are so many things which may happen and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say We shall all be armed in all ways and when the time for the end has come our effort shall not be lack Now let us today put all our affairs in order Let all things which touch on others dear to us and who on us depend be complete for none of us can tell what or when or how the end may be As for me my own affairs are regulate and as I have nothing else to do I shall go make arrangements for the travel I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey There was nothing further to be said and we parted I shall now settle up all my affairs of earth and be ready for whatever may come      LaterIt is all done my will is made and all complete Mina if she survive is my sole heir If it should not be so then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder It is now drawing towards the sunset Minas uneasiness calls my attention to it I am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new dangersome new pain which however may in Gods will be means to a good end I write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now but if it may be that she can see them again they shall be ready She is calling to me CHAPTER XXV DR SEWARDS DIARY 11 October EveningJonathan Harker has asked me to note this as he says he is hardly equal to the task and he wants an exact record kept I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs Harker a little before the time of sunset We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her or inciting her to action This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset and lasts till either the sun is high or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon At first there is a sort of negative condition as if some tie were loosened and then the absolute freedom quickly follows when however the freedom ceases the changeback or relapse comes quickly preceded only by a spell of warning silence Tonight when we met she was somewhat constrained and bore all the signs of an internal struggle I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so A very few minutes however gave her complete control of herself then motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining she made the rest of us bring chairs up close Taking her husbands hand in hers began We are all here together in freedom for perhaps the last time I know dear I know that you will always be with me to the end This was to her husband whose hand had as we could see tightened upon hers In the morning we go out upon our task and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us You are going to be so good to me as to take me with you I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman whose soul perhaps is lostno no not yet but is at any rate at stakeyou will do But you must remember that I am not as you are There is a poison in my blood in my soul which may destroy me which must destroy me unless some relief comes to us Oh my friends you know as well as I do that my soul is at stake and though I know there is one way out for me you must not and I must not take it She looked appealingly to us all in turn beginning and ending with her husband What is that way asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice What is that way which we must notmay nottake That I may die now either by my own hand or that of another before the greater evil is entirely wrought I know and you know that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit even as you did my poor Lucys Were death or the fear of death the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here now amidst the friends who love me But death is not all I cannot believe that to die in such a case when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done is Gods will Therefore I on my part give up here the certainty of eternal rest and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds We were all silent for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude The faces of the others were set and Harkers grew ashen grey perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming She continued This is what I can give into the hotchpot I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place and with all seriousness What will each of you give Your lives I know she went on quickly that is easy for brave men Your lives are Gods and you can give them back to Him but what will you give to me She looked again questioningly but this time avoided her husbands face Quincey seemed to understand he nodded and her face lit up Then I shall tell you plainly what I want for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now You must promise me one and alleven you my beloved husbandthat should the time come you will kill me What is that time The voice was Quinceys but it was low and strained When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I die than I may live When I am thus dead in the flesh then you will without a moments delay drive a stake through me and cut off my head or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest Quincey was the first to rise after the pause He knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly Im only a rough fellow who hasnt perhaps lived as a man should to win such a distinction but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and dear that should the time ever come I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us And I promise you too that I shall make all certain for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come My true friend was all she could say amid her fastfalling tears as bending over she kissed his hand I swear the same my dear Madam Mina said Van Helsing And I said Lord Godalming each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath I followed myself Then her husband turned to her waneyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair and asked And must I too make such a promise oh my wife You too my dearest she said with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes You must not shrink You are nearest and dearest and all the world to me our souls are knit into one for all life and all time Think dear that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy Their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them It is mens duty towards those whom they love in such times of sore trial And oh my dear if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand let it be at the hand of him that loves me best Dr Van Helsing I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucys case to him who lovedshe stopped with a flying blush and changed her phraseto him who had best right to give her peace If that time shall come again I look to you to make it a happy memory of my husbands life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me Again I swear came the Professors resonant voice Mrs Harker smiled positively smiled as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and said And now one word of warning a warning which you must never forget this time if it ever come may come quickly and unexpectedly and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity At such a time I myself might benay if the time ever comes shall beleagued with your enemy against you One more request she became very solemn as she said this it is not vital and necessary like the other but I want you to do one thing for me if you will We all acquiesced but no one spoke there was no need to speak I want you to read the Burial Service She was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband taking his hand in hers she held it over her heart and continued You must read it over me some day Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us You my dearest will I hope read it for then it will be in your voice in my memory for evercome what may But oh my dear one he pleaded death is afar off from you Nay she said holding up a warning hand I am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me Oh my wife must I read it he said before he began It would comfort me my husband was all she said and he began to read when she had got the book ready How can Ihow could any onetell of that strange scene its solemnity its gloom its sadness its horror and withal its sweetness Even a sceptic who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady or heard the tender passion of her husbands voice as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead II cannot go onwordsandvvoiceffail mme      She was right in her instinct Strange as it all was bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time it comforted us much and the silence which showed Mrs Harkers coming relapse from her freedom of soul did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded Jonathan Harkers Journal 15 October VarnaWe left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th got to Paris the same night and took the places secured for us in the Orient Express We travelled night and day arriving here at about five oclock Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him whilst the rest of us came on to this hotelthe Odessus The journey may have had incidents I was however too eager to get on to care for them Until the Czarina Catherine comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world Thank God Mina is well and looks to be getting stronger her colour is coming back She sleeps a great deal throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time Before sunrise and sunset however she is very wakeful and alert and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise her at such times At first some effort was needed and he had to make many passes but now she seems to yield at once as if by habit and scarcely any action is needed He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will and her thoughts obey him He always asks her what she can see and hear She answers to the first Nothing all is dark And to the second I can hear the waves lapping against the ship and the water rushing by Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak The wind is highI can hear it in the shrouds and the bow throws back the foam It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea hastening on her way to Varna Lord Godalming has just returned He had four telegrams one each day since we started and all to the same effect that the Czarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyds from anywhere He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported He was to have a message even if she were not reported so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire We had dinner and went to bed early Tomorrow we are to see the ViceConsul and to arrange if we can about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset The Count even if he takes the form of a bat cannot cross the running water of his own volition and so cannot leave the ship As he dare not change to mans form without suspicionwhich he evidently wishes to avoidhe must remain in the box If then we can come on board after sunrise he is at our mercy for we can open the box and make sure of him as we did of poor Lucy before he wakes What mercy he shall get from us will not count for much We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen Thank God this is the country where bribery can do anything and we are well supplied with money We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned and we shall be safe Judge Moneybag will settle this case I think      16 OctoberMinas report still the same lapping waves and rushing water darkness and favouring winds We are evidently in good time and when we hear of the Czarina Catherine we shall be ready As she must pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report      17 OctoberEverything is pretty well fixed now I think to welcome the Count on his return from his tour Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship and also a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna We have seen the agent who was much impressed with Godalmings kindly manner to him and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open If the Count is there Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready The Professor says that if we can so treat the Counts body it will soon after fall into dust In such case there would be no evidence against us in case any suspicion of murder were aroused But even if it were not we should stand or fall by our act and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope For myself I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the Czarina Catherine is seen we are to be informed by a special messenger      24 OctoberA whole week of waiting Daily telegrams to Godalming but only the same story Not yet reported Minas morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried lapping waves rushing water and creaking masts Telegram October 24th Rufus Smith Lloyds London to Lord Godalming care of H B M ViceConsul Varna Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles Dr Sewards Diary 25 OctoberHow I miss my phonograph To write diary with a pen is irksome to me but Van Helsing says I must We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyds I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard Mrs Harker alone of our party did not show any signs of emotion After all it is not strange that she did not for we took special care not to let her know anything about it and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence In old days she would I am sure have noticed no matter how we might have tried to conceal it but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks The lethargy grows upon her and though she seems strong and well and is getting back some of her colour Van Helsing and I are not satisfied We talk of her often we have not however said a word to the others It would break poor Harkers heartcertainly his nerveif he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject Van Helsing examines he tells me her teeth very carefully whilst she is in the hypnotic condition for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her If this change should come it would be necessary to take steps We both know what those steps would have to be though we do not mention our thoughts to each other We should neither of us shrink from the taskawful though it be to contemplate Euthanasia is an excellent and a comforting word I am grateful to whoever invented it It is only about 24 hours sail from the Dardanelles to here at the rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London She should therefore arrive some time in the morning but as she cannot possibly get in before then we are all about to retire early We shall get up at one oclock so as to be ready      25 October NoonNo news yet of the ships arrival Mrs Harkers hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual so it is possible that we may get news at any moment We men are all in a fever of excitement except Harker who is calm his hands are cold as ice and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that Kukri ever touches his throat driven by that stern icecold hand Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs Harker today About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like although we kept silence to the others we were neither of us happy about it She had been restless all the morning so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping When however her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her we went to her room to see for ourselves She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else Poor girl she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep if it brings oblivion to her does her good      LaterOur opinion was justified for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report Wherever he may be in the Black Sea the Count is hurrying to his destination To his doom I trust      26 OctoberAnother day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine She ought to be here by now That she is still journeying somewhere is apparent for Mrs Harkers hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same It is possible that the vessel may be lying by at times for fog some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port We must continue our watching as the ship may now be signalled any moment      27 October NoonMost strange no news yet of the ship we wait for Mrs Harker reported last night and this morning as usual lapping waves and rushing water though she added that the waves were very faint The telegrams from London have been the same no further report Van Helsing is terribly anxious and told me just now that he fears the Count is escaping us He added significantly I did not like that lethargy of Madam Minas Souls and memories can do strange things during trance I was about to ask him more but Harker just then came in and he held up a warning hand We must try tonight at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state      28 OctoberTelegram Rufus Smith London to Lord Godalming care H B M Vice Consul Varna Czarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one oclock today Dr Sewards Diary 28 OctoberWhen the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected True we did not know whence or how or when the bolt would come but I think we all expected that something strange would happen The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected we only waited to learn where the change would occur None the less however was it a surprise I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be not as we should know that they will be Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels even if it be a willothewisp to man It was an odd experience and we all took it differently Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment as though in remonstrance with the Almighty but he said not a word and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set Lord Godalming grew very pale and sat breathing heavily I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well in our old wandering days it meant action Mrs Harker grew ghastly white so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer Harker smiledactually smiledthe dark bitter smile of one who is without hope but at the same time his action belied his words for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there When does the next train start for Galatz said Van Helsing to us generally At 630 tomorrow morning We all started for the answer came from Mrs Harker How on earth do you know said Art You forgetor perhaps you do not know though Jonathan does and so does Dr Van Helsingthat I am the train fiend At home in Exeter I always used to make up the timetables so as to be helpful to my husband I found it so useful sometimes that I always make a study of the timetables now I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz or at any rate through Bucharest so I learned the times very carefully Unhappily there are not many to learn as the only train tomorrow leaves as I say Wonderful woman murmured the Professor Cant we get a special asked Lord Godalming Van Helsing shook his head I fear not This land is very different from yours or mine even if we did have a special it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train Moreover we have something to prepare We must think Now let us organize You friend Arthur go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning Do you friend Jonathan go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz with authority to make search the ship just as it was here Morris Quincey you see the ViceConsul and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth so that no times be lost when over the Danube John will stay with Madam Mina and me and we shall consult For so if time be long you may be delayed and it will not matter when the sun set since I am here with Madam to make report And I said Mrs Harker brightly and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day shall try to be of use in all ways and shall think and write for you as I used to do Something is shifting from me in some strange way and I feel freer than I have been of late The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words but Van Helsing and I turning to each other met each a grave and troubled glance We said nothing at the time however When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of Harkers journal at the Castle She went away to get it when the door was shut upon her he said to me We mean the same speak out There is some change It is a hope that makes me sick for it may deceive us Quite so Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript No said I unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone You are in part right friend John but only in part I want to tell you something And oh my friend I am taking a greata terriblerisk but I believe it is right In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both our understanding an inspiration came to me In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her mind or more like he took her to see him in his earthbox in the ship with water rushing just as it go free at rise and set of sun He learn then that we are here for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he shut as he is in his coffinbox Now he make his most effort to escape us At present he want her not He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call but he cut her offtake her as he can do out of his own power that so she come not to him Ah there I have hope that our manbrains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God will come higher than his childbrain that lie in his tomb for centuries that grow not yet to our stature and that do only work selfish and therefore small Here comes Madam Mina not a word to her of her trance She know it not and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope all her courage when most we want all her great brain which is trained like mans brain but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give her and which he may not take away altogetherthough he think not so Hush let me speak and you shall learn Oh John my friend we are in awful straits I fear as I never feared before We can only trust the good God Silence here she comes I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics just as he had when Lucy died but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs Harker tripped into the room bright and happylooking and in the doing of work seemingly forgetful of her misery As she came in she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing He looked over them gravely his face brightening up as he read Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said Friend John to you with so much of experience alreadyand you too dear Madam Mina that are younghere is a lesson do not fear ever to think A halfthought has been buzzing often in my brain but I fear to let him loose his wings Here now with more knowledge I go back to where that halfthought come from and I find that he be no halfthought at all that be a whole thought though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings Nay like the Ugly Duck of my friend Hans Andersen he be no duckthought at all but a big swanthought that sail nobly on big wings when the time come for him to try them See I read here what Jonathan have written That other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land who when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph What does this tell us Not much no The Counts childthought see nothing therefore he speak so free Your manthought see nothing my manthought see nothing till just now No But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she too know not what it meanwhat it might mean Just as there are elements which rest yet when in natures course they move on their way and they touchthen pouf and there comes a flash of light heaven wide that blind and kill and destroy some but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues Is it not so Well I shall explain To begin have you ever study the philosophy of crime Yes and No You John yes for it is a study of insanity You no Madam Mina for crime touch you notnot but once Still your mind works true and argues not a particulari ad universale There is this peculiarity in criminals It is so constant in all countries and at all times that even police who know not much from philosophy come to know it empirically that it is That is to be empiric The criminal always work at one crimethat is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime and who will of none other This criminal has not full manbrain He is clever and cunning and resourceful but he be not of manstature as to brain He be of childbrain in much Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also he too have childbrain and it is of the child to do what he have done The little bird the little fish the little animal learn not by principle but empirically and when he learn to do then there is to him the ground to start from to do more Dos pou sto said Archimedes Give me a fulcrum and I shall move the world To do once is the fulcrum whereby childbrain become manbrain and until he have the purpose to do more he continue to do the same again every time just as he have done before Oh my dear I see that your eyes are opened and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues for Mrs Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled He went on Now you shall speak Tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke His finger and thumb closed on her pulse as I thought instinctively and unconsciously as she spoke The Count is a criminal and of criminal type Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him and qu criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind Thus in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit His past is a clue and the one page of it that we knowand that from his own lipstells that once before when in what Mr Morris would call a tight place he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade and thence without losing purpose prepared himself for a new effort He came again better equipped for his work and won So he came to London to invade a new land He was beaten and when all hope of success was lost and his existence in danger he fled back over the sea to his home just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from Turkey Land Good good oh you so clever lady said Van Helsing enthusiastically as he stooped and kissed her hand A moment later he said to me as calmly as though we had been having a sickroom consultation Seventytwo only and in all this excitement I have hope Turning to her again he said with keen expectation But go on Go on there is more to tell if you will Be not afraid John and I know I do in any case and shall tell you if you are right Speak without fear I will try to but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical Nay fear not you must be egotist for it is of you that we think Then as he is criminal he is selfish and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness he confines himself to one purpose That purpose is remorseless As he fled back over the Danube leaving his forces to be cut to pieces so now he is intent on being safe careless of all So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night I felt it Oh I felt it Thank God for His great mercy My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends The Professor stood up He has so used your mind and by it he has left us here in Varna whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz where doubtless he had made preparation for escaping from us But his childmind only saw so far and it may be that as ever is in Gods Providence the very thing that the evildoer most reckoned on for his selfish good turns out to be his chiefest harm The hunter is taken in his own snare as the great Psalmist says For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him then his selfish childbrain will whisper him to sleep He think too that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind there can be no knowledge of him to you there is where he fail That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit as you have as yet done in your times of freedom when the sun rise and set At such times you go by my volition and not by his and this power to good of you and others as you have won from your suffering at his hands This is now all the more precious that he know it not and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where We however are not selfish and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness and these many dark hours We shall follow him and we shall not flinch even if we peril ourselves that we become like him Friend John this has been a great hour and it have done much to advance us on our way You must be scribe and write him all down so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them then they shall know as we do And so I have written it whilst we wait their return and Mrs Harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS to us CHAPTER XXVI DR SEWARDS DIARY 29 OctoberThis is written in the train from Varna to Galatz Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset Each of us had done his work as well as he could so far as thought and endeavour and opportunity go we are prepared for the whole of our journey and for our work when we get to Galatz When the usual time came round Mrs Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary she sank into the trance Usually she speaks on a hint but this time the Professor had to ask her questions and to ask them pretty resolutely before we could learn anything at last her answer came I can see nothing we are still there are no waves lapping but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser I can hear mens voices calling near and far and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks A gun is fired somewhere the echo of it seems far away There is tramping of feet overhead and ropes and chains are dragged along What is this There is a gleam of light I can feel the air blowing upon me Here she stopped She had risen as if impulsively from where she lay on the sofa and raised both her hands palms upwards as if lifting a weight Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently whilst Harkers hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri There was a long pause We all knew that the time when she could speak was passing but we felt that it was useless to say anything Suddenly she sat up and as she opened her eyes said sweetly Would none of you like a cup of tea You must all be so tired We could only make her happy and so acquiesced She bustled off to get tea when she had gone Van Helsing said You see my friends He is close to land he has left his earthchest But he has yet to get on shore In the night he may lie hidden somewhere but if he be not carried on shore or if the ship do not touch it he cannot achieve the land In such case he can if it be in the night change his form and can jump or fly on shore as he did at Whitby But if the day come before he get on shore then unless he be carried he cannot escape And if he be carried then the customs men may discover what the box contain Thus in fine if he escape not on shore tonight or before dawn there will be the whole day lost to him We may then arrive in time for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime boxed up and at our mercy for he dare not be his true self awake and visible lest he be discovered There was no more to be said so we waited in patience until the dawn at which time we might learn more from Mrs Harker Early this morning we listened with breathless anxiety for her response in her trance The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort at last in obedience to his will she made reply All is dark I hear lapping water level with me and some creaking as of wood on wood She paused and the red sun shot up We must wait till tonight And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of expectation We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning but already at Bucharest we are three hours late so we cannot possibly get in till well after sunup Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs Harker either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening      LaterSunset has come and gone Fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction for had it occurred whilst we were at a station we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation Mrs Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning I am in fear that her power of reading the Counts sensations may die away just when we want it most It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us If I thought that the Counts power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought but I am afraid that it may not be so When she did speak her words were enigmatical Something is going out I can feel it pass me like a cold wind I can hear far off confused soundsas of men talking in strange tongues fiercefalling water and the howling of wolves She stopped and a shudder ran through her increasing in intensity for a few seconds till at the end she shook as though in a palsy She said no more even in answer to the Professors imperative questioning When she woke from the trance she was cold and exhausted and languid but her mind was all alert She could not remember anything but asked what she had said when she was told she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence      30 October 7 a mWe are near Galatz now and I may not have time to write later Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual They produced no effect however until the regular time when she yielded with a still greater difficulty only a minute before the sun rose The Professor lost no time in his questioning her answer came with equal quickness All is dark I hear water swirling by level with my ears and the creaking of wood on wood Cattle low far off There is another sound a queer one like She stopped and grew white and whiter still Go on go on Speak I command you said Van Helsing in an agonised voice At the same time there was despair in his eyes for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs Harkers pale face She opened her eyes and we all started as she said sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern Oh Professor why ask me to do what you know I cant I dont remember anything Then seeing the look of amazement on our faces she said turning from one to the other with a troubled look What have I said What have I done I know nothing only that I was lying here half asleep and heard you say go on speak I command you It seemed so funny to hear you order me about as if I were a bad child Oh Madam Mina he said sadly it is proof if proof be needed of how I love and honour you when a word for your good spoken more earnest than ever can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to obey The whistles are sounding we are nearing Galatz We are on fire with anxiety and eagerness Mina Harkers Journal 30 OctoberMr Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph he being the one who could best be spared since he does not speak any foreign language The forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna except that Lord Godalming went to the ViceConsul as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official we being in extreme hurry Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the Czarina Catherine      LaterLord Godalming has returned The Consul is away and the ViceConsul sick so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk He was very obliging and offered to do anything in his power Jonathan Harkers Journal 30 OctoberAt nine oclock Dr Van Helsing Dr Seward and I called on Messrs Mackenzie  Steinkoff the agents of the London firm of Hapgood They had received a wire from London in answer to Lord Godalmings telegraphed request asking us to show them any civility in their power They were more than kind and courteous and took us at once on board the Czarina Catherine which lay at anchor out in the river harbour There we saw the Captain Donelson by name who told us of his voyage He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run Man he said but it made us afeard for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi some rare piece o ill luck so as to keep up the average Its no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi a wind ahint ye as though the Deil himself were blawin on yer sail for his ain purpose An a the time we could no speer a thing Gin we were nigh a ship or a port or a headland a fog fell on us and travelled wi us till when after it had lifted and we looked out the deil a thing could we see We ran by Gibraltar wioot bein able to signal an till we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass we never were within hail o aught At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted but whiles I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick he was like to do it whether we would or no If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi the owners or no hurt to our traffic an the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin him This mixture of simplicity and cunning of superstition and commercial reasoning aroused Van Helsing who said Mine friend that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some and he know when he meet his match The skipper was not displeased with the compliment and went on When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble some o them the Roumanians came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin old man just before we had started frae London I had seen them speer at the fellow and put out their twa fingers when they saw him to guard against the evil eye Man but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous I sent them aboot their business pretty quick but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something though I wouldnt say it was agin the big box Well on we went and as the fog didnt let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us for if the Deil wanted to get somewhereswell he would fetch it up areet An if he didnt well wed keep a sharp lookout anyhow Sure eneuch we had a fair way and deep water all the time and two days ago when the mornin sun came through the fog we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz The Roumanians were wild and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river I had to argy wi them aboot it wi a handspike an when the last o them rose off the deck wi his head in his hand I had convinced them that evil eye or no evil eye the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube They had mind ye taken the box on the deck ready to fling in and as it was marked Galatz via Varna I thocht Id let it lie till we discharged in the port an get rid ot althegither We didnt do much clearin that day an had to remain the nicht at anchor but in the mornin braw an airly an hour before sunup a man came aboard wi an order written to him from England to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand He had his papers a reet an glad I was to be rid o the dam thing for I was beginnin masel to feel uneasy at it If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship Im thinkin it was nane ither than that same What was the name of the man who took it asked Dr Van Helsing with restrained eagerness Ill be tellin ye quick he answered and stepping down to his cabin produced a receipt signed Immanuel Hildesheim Burgenstrasse 16 was the address We found out that this was all the Captain knew so with thanks we came away We found Hildesheim in his office a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi Theatre type with a nose like a sheep and a fez His arguments were pointed with speciewe doing the punctuationand with a little bargaining he told us what he knew This turned out to be simple but important He had received a letter from Mr de Ville of London telling him to receive if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs a box which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port He had been paid for his work by an English bank note which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank When Skinsky had come to him he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box so as to save porterage That was all he knew We then sought for Skinsky but were unable to find him One of his neighbours who did not seem to bear him any affection said that he had gone away two days before no one knew whither This was corroborated by his landlord who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due in English money This had been between ten and eleven oclock last night We were at a standstill again Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of St Peter and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror the women crying out This is the work of a Slovak We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair and so detained As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion We were all convinced that the box was on its way by water to somewhere but where that might be we would have to discover With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina When we met together the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again into our confidence Things are getting desperate and it is at least a chance though a hazardous one As a preliminary step I was released from my promise to her Mina Harkers Journal 30 October eveningThey were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest so I asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment I feel so grateful to the man who invented the Travellers typewriter and to Mr Morris for getting this one for me I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write with a pen It is all done poor dear dear Jonathan what he must have suffered what must he be suffering now He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe and his whole body appears in collapse His brows are knit his face is drawn with pain Poor fellow maybe he is thinking and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts Oh if I could only help at all I shall do what I can I have asked Dr Van Helsing and he has got me all the papers that I have not yet seen Whilst they are resting I shall go over all carefully and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion I shall try to follow the Professors example and think without prejudice on the facts before me      I do believe that under Gods providence I have made a discovery I shall get the maps and look over them      I am more than ever sure that I am right My new conclusion is ready so I shall get our party together and read it They can judge it it is well to be accurate and every minute is precious Mina Harkers Memorandum Entered in her Journal Ground of inquiryCount Draculas problem is to get back to his own place a He must be brought back by some one This is evident for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man or wolf or bat or in some other way He evidently fears discovery or interference in the state of helplessness in which he must beconfined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box b How is he to be takenHere a process of exclusions may help us By road by rail by water 1 By RoadThere are endless difficulties especially in leaving the city x There are people and people are curious and investigate A hint a surmise a doubt as to what might be in the box would destroy him y There are or there may be customs and octroi officers to pass z His pursuers might follow This is his highest fear and in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled so far as he can even his victimme 2 By RailThere is no one in charge of the box It would have to take its chance of being delayed and delay would be fatal with enemies on the track True he might escape at night but what would he be if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to This is not what he intends and he does not mean to risk it 3 By WaterHere is the safest way in one respect but with most danger in another On the water he is powerless except at night even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves But were he wrecked the living water would engulf him helpless and he would indeed be lost He could have the vessel drive to land but if it were unfriendly land wherein he was not free to move his position would still be desperate We know from the record that he was on the water so what we have to do is to ascertain what water The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet we may then get a light on what his later task is to be FirstlyWe must differentiate between what he did in London as part of his general plan of action when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could Secondly we must see as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of what he has done here As to the first he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from England his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape The proof of this is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky These we must only guess at but there must have been some letter or message since Skinsky came to Hildesheim That so far his plans were successful we know The Czarina Catherine made a phenomenally quick journeyso much so that Captain Donelsons suspicions were aroused but his superstition united with his canniness played the Counts game for him and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz That the Counts arrangements were well made has been proved Hildesheim cleared the box took it off and gave it to Skinsky Skinsky took itand here we lose the trail We only know that the box is somewhere on the water moving along The customs and the octroi if there be any have been avoided Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrivalon land at Galatz The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise At sunrise the Count could appear in his own form Here we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work In my husbands diary Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port and the mans remark that the murder was the work of a Slovak showed the general feeling against his class The Count wanted isolation My surmise is this that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water as the most safe and secret way He was brought from the castle by Szgany and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna for there they were shipped for London Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service When the box was on land before sunrise or after sunset he came out from his box met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river When this was done and he knew that all was in train he blotted out his traces as he thought by murdering his agent I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood The Count in his box then was on a river in an open boatpropelled probably either by oars or poles for the banks are near and it is working against stream There would be no such sound if floating down stream Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth but we may possibly investigate further Now of these two the Pruth is the more easily navigated but the Sereth is at Fundu joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Draculas castle as can be got by water Mina Harkers Journalcontinued When I had done reading Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me The others kept shaking me by both hands and Dr Van Helsing said Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher Her eyes have been where we were blinded Now we are on the track once again and this time we may succeed Our enemy is at his most helpless and if we can come on him by day on the water our task will be over He has a start but he is powerless to hasten as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish This he knows and will not Now men to our Council of War for here and now we must plan what each and all shall do I shall get a steam launch and follow him said Lord Godalming And I horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land said Mr Morris Good said the Professor both good But neither must go alone There must be force to overcome force if need be the Slovak is strong and rough and he carries rude arms All the men smiled for amongst them they carried a small arsenal Said Mr Morris I have brought some Winchesters they are pretty handy in a crowd and there may be wolves The Count if you remember took some other precautions he made some requisitions on others that Mrs Harker could not quite hear or understand We must be ready at all points Dr Seward said I think I had better go with Quincey We have been accustomed to hunt together and we two well armed will be a match for whatever may come along You must not be alone Art It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks and a chance thrustfor I dont suppose these fellows carry gunswould undo all our plans There must be no chances this time we shall not rest until the Counts head and body have been separated and we are sure that he cannot reincarnate He looked at Jonathan as he spoke and Jonathan looked at me I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind Of course he wanted to be with me but then the boat service would most likely be the one which would destroy the  the  the  Vampire Why did I hesitate to write the word He was silent awhile and during his silence Dr Van Helsing spoke Friend Jonathan this is to you for twice reasons First because you are young and brave and can fight and all energies may be needed at the last and again that it is your right to destroy himthatwhich has wrought such woe to you and yours Be not afraid for Madam Mina she will be my care if I may I am old My legs are not so quick to run as once and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be or to fight with lethal weapons But I can be of other service I can fight in other way And I can die if need be as well as younger men Now let me say that what I would is this while you my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemys country Whilst the old fox is tied in his box floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to landwhere he dares not raise the lid of his coffinbox lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perishwe shall go in the track where Jonathan wentfrom Bistritz over the Borgo and find our way to the Castle of Dracula Here Madam Minas hypnotic power will surely help and we shall find our wayall dark and unknown otherwiseafter the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place There is much to be done and other places to be made sanctify so that that nest of vipers be obliterated Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly Do you mean to say Professor Van Helsing that you would bring Mina in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devils illness right into the jaws of his deathtrap Not for the world Not for Heaven or Hell He became almost speechless for a minute and then went on Do you know what the place is Have you seen that awful den of hellish infamywith the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo Have you felt the Vampires lips upon your throat Here he turned to me and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry Oh my God what have we done to have this terror upon us and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery The Professors voice as he spoke in clear sweet tones which seemed to vibrate in the air calmed us all Oh my friend it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful place that I would go God forbid that I should take her into that place There is workwild workto be done there that her eyes may not see We men here all save Jonathan have seen with their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify Remember that we are in terrible straits If the Count escape us this timeand he is strong and subtle and cunninghe may choose to sleep him for a century and then in time our dear onehe took my handwould come to him to keep him company and would be as those others that you Jonathan saw You have told us of their gloating lips you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them You shudder and well may it be Forgive me that I make you so much pain but it is necessary My friend is it not a dire need for the which I am giving possibly my life If it were that any one went into that place to stay it is I who would have to go to keep them company Do as you will said Jonathan with a sob that shook him all over we are in the hands of God      LaterOh it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked How can women help loving men when they are so earnest and so true and so brave And too it made me think of the wonderful power of money What can it not do when it is properly applied and what might it do when basely used I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich and that both he and Mr Morris who also has plenty of money are willing to spend it so freely For if they did not our little expedition could not start either so promptly or so well equipped as it will within another hour It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch with steam up ready to start at a moments notice Dr Seward and Mr Morris have half a dozen good horses well appointed We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 1140 train tonight for Veresti where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass We are bringing a good deal of ready money as we are to buy a carriage and horses We shall drive ourselves for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter The Professor knows something of a great many languages so we shall get on all right We have all got arms even for me a largebore revolver Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest Alas I cannot carry one arm that the rest do the scar on my forehead forbids that Dear Dr Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves the weather is getting colder every hour and there are snowflurries which come and go as warnings      LaterIt took all my courage to say goodbye to my darling We may never meet again Courage Mina the Professor is looking at you keenly his look is a warning There must be no tears nowunless it may be that God will let them fall in gladness Jonathan Harkers Journal October 30 NightI am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch Lord Godalming is firing up He is an experienced hand at the work as he has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames and another on the Norfolk Broads Regarding our plans we finally decided that Minas guess was correct and that if any waterway was chosen for the Counts escape back to his Castle the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction would be the one We took it that somewhere about the 47th degree north latitude would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night there is plenty of water and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming even in the dark easy enough Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch But I cannot sleephow can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling and her going out into that awful place My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live and so be quit of all the trouble Mr Morris and Dr Seward were off on their long ride before we started they are to keep up the right bank far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves They have for the first stages two men to ride and lead their spare horsesfour in all so as not to excite curiosity When they dismiss the men which shall be shortly they shall themselves look after the horses It may be necessary for us to join forces if so they can mount our whole party One of the saddles has a movable horn and can be easily adapted for Mina if required It is a wild adventure we are on Here as we are rushing along through the darkness with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us with all the mysterious voices of the night around us it all comes home We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways into a whole world of dark and dreadful things Godalming is shutting the furnace door      31 OctoberStill hurrying along The day has come and Godalming is sleeping I am on watch The morning is bitterly cold the furnace heat is grateful though we have heavy fur coats As yet we have passed only a few open boats but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek The men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them and fell on their knees and prayed      1 November eveningNo news all day we have found nothing of the kind we seek We have now passed into the Bistritza and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone We have overhauled every boat big and little Early this morning one crew took us for a Government boat and treated us accordingly We saw in this a way of smoothing matters so at Fundu where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously With every boat which we have overhauled since then this trick has succeeded we have had every deference shown to us and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board This was before they came to Fundu so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat so she must have passed there in the night I am feeling very sleepy the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me and nature must have rest some time Godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and me      2 November morningIt is broad daylight That good fellow would not wake me He says it would have been a sin to for I slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long and let him watch all night but he was quite right I am a new man this morning and as I sit here and watch him sleeping I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine steering and keeping watch I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me I wonder where Mina is now and Van Helsing They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses so if they had started and travelled hard they would be about now at the Borgo Pass God guide and help them I am afraid to think what may happen If we could only go faster but we cannot the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost I wonder how Dr Seward and Mr Morris are getting on There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river but as none of them are very largeat present at all events though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow meltsthe horsemen may not have met much obstruction I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next Dr Sewards Diary 2 NovemberThree days on the road No news and no time to write it if there had been for every moment is precious We have had only the rest needful for the horses but we are both bearing it wonderfully Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful We must push on we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again      3 NovemberWe heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the Bistritza I wish it wasnt so cold There are signs of snow coming and if it falls heavy it will stop us In such case we must get a sledge and go on Russian fashion      4 NovemberToday we heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids The Slovak boats get up all right by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge Some went up only a few hours before Godalming is an amateur fitter himself and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again Finally they got up the rapids all right with local help and are off on the chase afresh I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight We must push on harder than ever our help may be wanted soon Mina Harkers Journal 31 OctoberArrived at Veresti at noon The Professor tells me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all and that all I could say was dark and quiet He is off now buying a carriage and horses He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses so that we may be able to change them on the way We have something more than 70 miles before us The country is lovely and most interesting if only we were under different conditions how delightful it would be to see it all If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be To stop and see people and learn something of their life and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild beautiful country and the quaint people But alas      LaterDr Van Helsing has returned He has got the carriage and horses we are to have some dinner and to start in an hour The landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions it seems enough for a company of soldiers The Professor encourages her and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again He has been shopping too and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps and all sorts of warm things There will not be any chance of our being cold      We shall soon be off I am afraid to think what may happen to us We are truly in the hands of God He alone knows what may be and I pray Him with all the strength of my sad and humble soul that He will watch over my beloved husband that whatever may happen Jonathan may know that I loved him and honoured him more than I can say and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him CHAPTER XXVII MINA HARKERS JOURNAL 1 NovemberAll day long we have travelled and at a good speed The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated for they go willingly their full stage at best speed We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one Dr Van Helsing is laconic he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz and pays them well to make the exchange of horses We get hot soup or coffee or tea and off we go It is a lovely country full of beauties of all imaginable kinds and the people are brave and strong and simple and seem full of nice qualities They are very very superstitious In the first house where we stopped when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me to keep off the evil eye I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food and I cant abide garlic Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil and so have escaped their suspicions We are travelling fast and as we have no driver with us to carry tales we go ahead of scandal but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way The Professor seems tireless all day he would not take any rest though he made me sleep for a long spell At sunset time he hypnotised me and he says that I answered as usual darkness lapping water and creaking wood so our enemy is still on the river I am afraid to think of Jonathan but somehow I have now no fear for him or for myself I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready Dr Van Helsing is sleeping Poor dear he looks very tired and old and grey but his mouth is set as firmly as a conquerors even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I drive I shall tell him that we have days before us and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed All is ready we are off shortly      2 November morningI was successful and we took turns driving all night now the day is on us bright though cold There is a strange heaviness in the airI say heaviness for want of a better word I mean that it oppresses us both It is very cold and only our warm furs keep us comfortable At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me he says I answered darkness creaking wood and roaring water so the river is changing as they ascend I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of dangermore than need be but we are in Gods hands      2 November nightAll day long driving The country gets wilder as we go and the great spurs of the Carpathians which at Veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon now seem to gather round us and tower in front We both seem in good spirits I think we make an effort each to cheer the other in the doing so we cheer ourselves Dr Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass The houses are very few here now and the Professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us as we may not be able to change He got two in addition to the two we changed so that now we have a rude fourinhand The dear horses are patient and good and they give us no trouble We are not worried with other travellers and so even I can drive We shall get to the Pass in daylight we do not want to arrive before So we take it easy and have each a long rest in turn Oh what will tomorrow bring to us We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much God grant that we may be guided aright and that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both and who are in such deadly peril As for me I am not worthy in His sight Alas I am unclean to His eyes and shall be until He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred His wrath Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing 4 NovemberThis to my old and true friend John Seward MD of Purfleet London in case I may not see him It may explain It is morning and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept aliveMadam Mina aiding me It is cold cold so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it It seems to have affected Madam Mina she has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself She sleeps and sleeps and sleeps She who is usual so alert have done literally nothing all the day she even have lost her appetite She make no entry into her little diary she who write so faithful at every pause Something whisper to me that all is not well However tonight she is more vif Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her for now she is all sweet and bright as ever At sunset I try to hypnotise her but alas with no effect the power has grown less and less with each day and tonight it fail me altogether Well Gods will be donewhatever it may be and whithersoever it may lead Now to the historical for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography I must in my cumbrous old fashion that so each day of us may not go unrecorded We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism We stopped our carriage and got down so that there might be no disturbance I made a couch with furs and Madam Mina lying down yield herself as usual but more slow and more short time than ever to the hypnotic sleep As before came the answer darkness and the swirling of water Then she woke bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass At this time and place she become all on fire with zeal some new guiding power be in her manifested for she point to a road and say This is the way How know you it I ask Of course I know it she answer and with a pause add Have not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel At first I think somewhat strange but soon I see that there be only one such byroad It is used but little and very different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz which is more wide and hard and more of use So we came down this road when we meet other waysnot always were we sure that they were roads at all for they be neglect and light snow have fallenthe horses know and they only I give rein to them and they go on so patient Byandby we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him Then we go on for long long hours and hours At the first I tell Madam Mina to sleep she try and she succeed She sleep all the time till at the last I feel myself to suspicious grow and attempt to wake her But she sleep on and I may not wake her though I try I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her for I know that she have suffer much and sleep at times be allinall to her I think I drowse myself for all of sudden I feel guilt as though I have done something I find myself bolt up with the reins in my hand and the good horses go along jog jog just as ever I look down and find Madam Mina still sleep It is now not far off sunset time and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep For we are going up and up and all is oh so wild and rocky as though it were the end of the world Then I arouse Madam Mina This time she wake with not much trouble and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep But she sleep not being as though I were not Still I try and try till all at once I find her and myself in dark so I look round and find that the sun have gone down Madam Mina laugh and I turn and look at her She is now quite awake and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we first enter the Counts house I am amaze and not at ease then but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear I light a fire for we have brought supply of wood with us and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them tethered in shelter to feed Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready I go to help her but she smile and tell me that she have eat alreadythat she was so hungry that she would not wait I like it not and I have grave doubts but I fear to affright her and so I am silent of it She help me and I eat alone and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire and I tell her to sleep while I watch But presently I forget all of watching and when I sudden remember that I watch I find her lying quiet but awake and looking at me with so bright eyes Once twice more the same occur and I get much sleep till before morning When I wake I try to hypnotise her but alas though she shut her eyes obedient she may not sleep The sun rise up and up and up and then sleep come to her too late but so heavy that she will not wake I have to lift her up and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready Madam still sleep and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before And I like it not And I am afraid afraid afraidI am afraid of all thingseven to think but I must go on my way The stake we play for is life and death or more than these and we must not flinch      5 November morningLet me be accurate in everything for though you and I have seen some strange things together you may at the first think that I Van Helsing am madthat the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain All yesterday we travel ever getting closer to the mountains and moving into a more and more wild and desert land There are great frowning precipices and much falling water and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival Madam Mina still sleep and sleep and though I did have hunger and appeased it I could not waken hereven for food I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism Well said I to myself if it be that she sleep all the day it shall also be that I do not sleep at night As we travel on the rough road for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was I held down my head and slept Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed and found Madam Mina still sleeping and the sun low down But all was indeed changed the frowning mountains seemed further away and we were near the top of a steeprising hill on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary At once I exulted and feared for now for good or ill the end was near I woke Madam Mina and again tried to hypnotise her but alas unavailing till too late Then ere the great dark came upon usfor even after downsun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow and all was for a time in a great twilightI took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could Then I make a fire and near it I make Madam Mina now awake and more charming than ever sit comfortable amid her rugs I got ready food but she would not eat simply saying that she had not hunger I did not press her knowing her unavailingness But I myself eat for I must needs now be strong for all Then with the fear on me of what might be I drew a ring so big for her comfort round where Madam Mina sat and over the ring I passed some of the wafer and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded She sat still all the timeso still as one dead and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale and no word she said But when I drew near she clung to me and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel I said to her presently when she had grown more quiet Will you not come over to the fire for I wished to make a test of what she could She rose obedient but when she have made a step she stopped and stood as one stricken Why not go on I asked She shook her head and coming back sat down in her place Then looking at me with open eyes as of one waked from sleep she said simply I cannot and remained silent I rejoiced for I knew that what she could not none of those that we dreaded could Though there might be danger to her body yet her soul was safe Presently the horses began to scream and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them When they did feel my hands on them they whinnied low as in joy and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time Many times through the night did I come to them till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest and every time my coming was with quiet of them In the cold hour the fire began to die and I was about stepping forth to replenish it for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist Even in the dark there was a light of some kind as there ever is over snow and it seemed as though the snowflurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments All was in dead grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered as if in terror of the worst I began to fearhorrible fears but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood I began too to think that my imaginings were of the night and the gloom and the unrest that I have gone through and all the terrible anxiety It was as though my memories of all Jonathans horrid experience were befooling me for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him And then the horses cowered lower and lower and moaned in terror as men do in pain Even the madness of fright was not to them so that they could break away I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round I looked at her but she sat calm and smiled at me when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it she caught me and held me back and whispered like a voice that one hears in a dream so low it was No No Do not go without Here you are safe I turned to her and looking in her eyes said But you It is for you that I fear whereat she laugheda laugh low and unreal and said Fear for me Why fear for me None safer in all the world from them than I am and as I wondered at the meaning of her words a puff of wind made the flame leap up and I see the red scar on her forehead Then alas I knew Did I not I would soon have learned for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer but keeping ever without the Holy circle Then they began to materialise tillif God have not take away my reason for I saw it through my eyesthere were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room when they would have kissed his throat I knew the swaying round forms the bright hard eyes the white teeth the ruddy colour the voluptuous lips They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina and as their laugh came through the silence of the night they twined their arms and pointed to her and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the waterglasses Come sister Come to us Come Come In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina and my heart with gladness leapt like flame for oh the terror in her sweet eyes the repulsion the horror told a story to my heart that was all of hope God be thanked she was not yet of them I seized some of the firewood which was by me and holding out some of the Wafer advanced on them towards the fire They drew back before me and laughed their low horrid laugh I fed the fire and feared them not for I knew that we were safe within our protections They could not approach me whilst so armed nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring which she could not leave no more than they could enter The horses had ceased to moan and lay still on the ground the snow fell on them softly and they grew whiter I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snowgloom I was desolate and afraid and full of woe and terror but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle and were lost Instinctively with the dawn coming I turned to Madam Mina intending to hypnotise her but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep from which I could not wake her I tried to hypnotise through her sleep but she made no response none at all and the day broke I fear yet to stir I have made my fire and have seen the horses they are all dead Today I have much to do here and I keep waiting till the sun is up high for there may be places where I must go where that sunlight though snow and mist obscure it will be to me a safety I will strengthen me with breakfast and then I will to my terrible work Madam Mina still sleeps and God be thanked she is calm in her sleep Jonathan Harkers Journal 4 November eveningThe accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago and by now my dear Mina would have been free I fear to think of her off on the wolds near that horrid place We have got horses and we follow on the track I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready We have our arms The Szgany must look out if they mean fight Oh if only Morris and Seward were with us We must only hope If I write no more Goodbye Mina God bless and keep you Dr Sewards Diary 5 NovemberWith the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing away from the river with their leiterwagon They surrounded it in a cluster and hurried along as though beset The snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air It may be our own feelings but the depression is strange Far off I hear the howling of wolves the snow brings them down from the mountains and there are dangers to all of us and from all sides The horses are nearly ready and we are soon off We ride to death of some one God alone knows who or where or what or when or how it may be Dr Van Helsings Memorandum 5 November afternoonI am at least sane Thank God for that mercy at all events though the proving it has been dreadful When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle I took my way to the castle The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges lest some illintent or illchance should close them so that being entered I might not get out Jonathans bitter experience served me here By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel for I knew that here my work lay The air was oppressive it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume which at times made me dizzy Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina and I was in terrible plight The dilemma had me between his horns Her I had not dare to take into this place but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle and yet even there would be the wolf I resolve me that my work lay here and that as to the wolves we must submit if it were Gods will At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond So did I choose for her Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire So I make my choice to go on with my work I knew that there were at least three graves to findgraves that are inhabit so I search and search and I find one of them She lay in her Vampire sleep so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder Ah I doubt not that in old time when such things were many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine found at the last his heart fail him and then his nerve So he delay and delay and delay till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton UnDead have hypnotise him and he remain on and on till sunset come and the Vampire sleep be over Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love and the voluptuous mouth present to a kissand man is weak And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the UnDead There is some fascination surely when I am moved by the mere presence of such an one even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the Count have had Yes I was movedI Van Helsing with all my purpose and with my motive for hateI was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul It may have been that the need of natural sleep and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep the openeyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination when there came through the snowstilled air a long low wail so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard Then I braced myself again to my horrid task and found by wrenching away tombtops one other of the sisters the other dark one I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister lest once more I should begin to be enthrall but I go on searching until presently I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist She was so fair to look on so radiantly beautiful so exquisitely voluptuous that the very instinct of man in me which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers made my head whirl with new emotion But God be thanked that soulwail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears and before the spell could be wrought further upon me I had nerved myself to my wild work By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel so far as I could tell and as there had been only three of these UnDead phantoms around us in the night I took it that there were no more of active UnDead existent There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest huge it was and nobly proportioned On it was but one word DRACULA This then was the UnDead home of the KingVampire to whom so many more were due Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work I laid in Draculas tomb some of the Wafer and so banished him from it UnDead for ever Then began my terrible task and I dreaded it Had it been but one it had been easy comparative But three To begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror for if it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years who would if they could have fought for their foul lives Oh my friend John but it was butcher work had I not been nerved by thoughts of other dead and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear I could not have gone on I tremble and tremble even yet though till all was over God be thanked my nerve did stand Had I not seen the repose in the first place and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came as realisation that the soul had been won I could not have gone further with my butchery I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home the plunging of writhing form and lips of bloody foam I should have fled in terror and left my work undone But it is over And the poor souls I can pity them now and weep as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading For friend John hardly had my knife severed the head of each before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud I am here Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can the Count enter there UnDead When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept she woke from her sleep and seeing me cried out in pain that I had endured too much Come she said come away from this awful place Let us go to meet my husband who is I know coming towards us She was looking thin and pale and weak but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour I was glad to see her paleness and her illness for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep And so with trust and hope and yet full of fear we go eastward to meet our friendsand himwhom Madam Mina tell me that she know are coming to meet us Mina Harkers Journal 6 NovemberIt was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming We did not go fast though the way was steeply downhill for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow We had to take some of our provisions too for we were in a perfect desolation and so far as we could see through the snowfall there was not even the sign of habitation When we had gone about a mile I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Draculas castle cut the sky for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it We saw it in all its grandeur perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side There was something wild and uncanny about the place We could hear the distant howling of wolves They were far off but the sound even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall was full of terror I knew from the way Dr Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point where we would be less exposed in case of attack The rough roadway still led downwards we could trace it through the drifted snow In a little while the Professor signalled to me so I got up and joined him He had found a wonderful spot a sort of natural hollow in a rock with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders He took me by the hand and drew me in See he said here you will be in shelter and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one He brought in our furs and made a snug nest for me and got out some provisions and forced them upon me But I could not eat to even try to do so was repulsive to me and much as I would have liked to please him I could not bring myself to the attempt He looked very sad but did not reproach me Taking his fieldglasses from the case he stood on the top of the rock and began to search the horizon Suddenly he called out Look Madam Mina look look I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock he handed me his glasses and pointed The snow was now falling more heavily and swirled about fiercely for a high wind was beginning to blow However there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance and far off beyond the white waste of snow I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way Straight in front of us and not far offin fact so near that I wondered we had not noticed beforecame a group of mounted men hurrying along In the midst of them was a cart a long leiterwagon which swept from side to side like a dogs tail wagging with each stern inequality of the road Outlined against the snow as they were I could see from the mens clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind On the cart was a great square chest My heart leaped as I saw it for I felt that the end was coming The evening was now drawing close and well I knew that at sunset the Thing which was till then imprisoned there would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit In fear I turned to the Professor to my consternation however he was not there An instant later I saw him below me Round the rock he had drawn a circle such as we had found shelter in last night When he had completed it he stood beside me again saying At least you shall be safe here from him He took the glasses from me and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us See he said they come quickly they are flogging the horses and galloping as hard as they can He paused and went on in a hollow voice They are racing for the sunset We may be too late Gods will be done Down came another blinding rush of driving snow and the whole landscape was blotted out It soon passed however and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain Then came a sudden cry Look Look Look See two horsemen follow fast coming up from the south It must be Quincey and John Take the glass Look before the snow blots it all out I took it and looked The two men might be Dr Seward and Mr Morris I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan At the same time I knew that Jonathan was not far off looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men riding at breakneck speed One of them I knew was Jonathan and the other I took of course to be Lord Godalming They too were pursuing the party with the cart When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy and after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter They are all converging he said When the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides I got out my revolver ready to hand for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us and beyond the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbersthe wolves were gathering for their prey Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited The wind came now in fierce bursts and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies At times we could not see an arms length before us but at others as the hollowsounding wind swept by us it seemed to clear the airspace around us so that we could see afar off We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be and we knew that before long the sun would set It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps and more steadily from the north It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us for with only occasional bursts the snow fell We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party the pursued and the pursuers Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise or at least to care that they were pursued they seemed however to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops Closer and closer they drew The Professor and I crouched down behind our rock and held our weapons ready I could see that he was determined that they should not pass One and all were quite unaware of our presence All at once two voices shouted out to Halt One was my Jonathans raised in a high key of passion the other Mr Morris strong resolute tone of quiet command The gypsies may not have known the language but there was no mistaking the tone in whatever tongue the words were spoken Instinctively they reined in and at the instant Lord Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr Seward and Mr Morris on the other The leader of the gypsies a splendidlooking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur waved them back and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed They lashed the horses which sprang forward but the four men raised their Winchester rifles and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop At the same moment Dr Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried knife or pistol and held himself in readiness to attack Issue was joined in an instant The leader with a quick movement of his rein threw his horse out in front and pointing first to the sunnow close down on the hill topsand then to the castle said something which I did not understand For answer all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart I should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them I felt no fear but only a wild surging desire to do something Seeing the quick movement of our parties the leader of the gypsies gave a command his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men and Quincey on the other were forcing a way to the cart it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front nor the howling of the wolves behind appeared to even attract their attention Jonathans impetuosity and the manifest singleness of his purpose seemed to overawe those in front of him instinctively they cowered aside and let him pass In an instant he had jumped upon the cart and with a strength which seemed incredible raised the great box and flung it over the wheel to the ground In the meantime Mr Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had with the tail of my eye seen him pressing desperately forward and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them and they cut at him He had parried with his great bowie knife and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety but as he sprang beside Jonathan who had by now jumped from the cart I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side and that the blood was spurting through his fingers He did not delay notwithstanding this for as Jonathan with desperate energy attacked one end of the chest attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife he attacked the other frantically with his bowie Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield the nails drew with a quick screeching sound and the top of the box was thrown back By this time the gypsies seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr Seward had given in and made no resistance The sun was almost down on the mountain tops and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him He was deathly pale just like a waxen image and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well As I looked the eyes saw the sinking sun and the look of hate in them turned to triumph But on the instant came the sweep and flash of Jonathans great knife I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat whilst at the same moment Mr Morriss bowie knife plunged into the heart It was like a miracle but before our very eyes and almost in the drawing of a breath the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution there was in the face a look of peace such as I never could have imagined might have rested there The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun The gypsies taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man turned without a word and rode away as if for their lives Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiterwagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them The wolves which had withdrawn to a safe distance followed in their wake leaving us alone Mr Morris who had sunk to the ground leaned on his elbow holding his hand pressed to his side the blood still gushed through his fingers I flew to him for the Holy circle did not now keep me back so did the two doctors Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder With a sigh he took with a feeble effort my hand in that of his own which was unstained He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face for he smiled at me and said I am only too happy to have been of any service Oh God he cried suddenly struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me It was worth for this to die Look look The sun was now right down upon the mountain top and the red gleams fell upon my face so that it was bathed in rosy light With one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest Amen broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger The dying man spoke Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain See the snow is not more stainless than her forehead The curse has passed away And to our bitter grief with a smile and in silence he died a gallant gentleman NOTE Seven years ago we all went through the flames and the happiness of some of us since then is we think well worth the pain we endured It is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boys birthday is the same day as that on which Quincey Morris died His mother holds I know the secret belief that some of our brave friends spirit has passed into him His bundle of names links all our little band of men together but we call him Quincey In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania and went over the old ground which was and is to us so full of vivid and terrible memories It was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths Every trace of all that had been was blotted out The castle stood as before reared high above a waste of desolation When we got home we were talking of the old timewhich we could all look back on without despair for Godalming and Seward are both happily married I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago We were struck with the fact that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed there is hardly one authentic document nothing but a mass of typewriting except the later notebooks of Mina and Seward and myself and Van Helsings memorandum We could hardly ask any one even did we wish to to accept these as proofs of so wild a story Van Helsing summed it all up as he said with our boy on his knee We want no proofs we ask none to believe us This boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is Already he knows her sweetness and loving care later on he will understand how some men so loved her that they did dare much for her sake JONATHAN HARKER THE END      Theres More

Presently said Van Helsing : -- “ really Lucy ’ body , demon shape ? ” “ body , yet . wait , see , is. ” seemed like nightmare Lucy lay ; pointed teeth , bloodstained , voluptuous mouth -- made one shudder see -- whole carnal unspiritual appearance , seeming like devilish mockery Lucy ’ sweet purity .

Oh , poor darling ! ” spoke , took husband ’ grey head hands kissed -- “ Lay poor head rest . yet well , dear ! God protect us good intent. ” poor fellow groaned . place words sublime misery . sort perfunctory supper together , think cheered us somewhat . , perhaps , mere animal heat food hungry people -- none us eaten anything since breakfast -- sense companionship may helped us ; anyhow less miserable , saw morrow altogether without hope . True promise , told Mrs. Harker everything passed ; although grew snowy white times danger seemed threaten husband , red others devotion manifested , listened bravely calmness . came part Harker rushed Count recklessly , clung husband ’ arm , held tight though clinging could protect harm might come . said nothing , however , till narration done , matters brought right present time . without letting go husband ’ hand stood amongst us spoke . Oh , could give idea scene ; sweet , sweet , good , good woman radiant beauty youth animation , red scar forehead , conscious , saw grinding teeth -- remembering whence came ; loving kindness grim hate ; tender faith fears doubting ; , knowing far symbols went , goodness purity faith , outcast God . “ Jonathan , ” said , word sounded like music lips full love tenderness , “ Jonathan dear , true , true friends , want bear something mind dreadful time . know must fight -- must destroy even destroyed false Lucy true Lucy might live hereafter ; work hate . poor soul wrought misery saddest case . think joy , , destroyed worser part better part may spiritual immortality . must pitiful , , though may hold hands destruction. ” spoke could see husband ’ face darken draw together , though passion shrivelling core .
