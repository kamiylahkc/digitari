Solution for Digitari ML / Python Developer Tech Test

### How to set up environment and run application
- Please make sure to install all required packages using the requirements.txt file. 
- Additionally please install the following by running 'python -m spacy download en_core_web_md' in your terminal (Please visit https://spacy.io/usage for the correct commands for your OS)
- Run by activating the virtual environment, running 'python solution/api.py' in your terminal from the digitari folder and sending a GET request to 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/process_text' along with your posted json (I used the postman app). 
- Feel free to take a look at my experiments folder where I code through some alternate methods 


To Note:
- The code does take a few moments to run
- I am aware that there are improvements to be made and would appreciate the chance to discuss these during a meeting as well as go over my solution with you.
